0,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
1,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

7,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
8,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"

10,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

12,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."

 I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
14,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
15,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
16,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
17,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
18,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
19,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
20,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
21,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

22,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point.

23,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
24,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
25,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
26,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
27,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
28,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice.

I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.

Sound quality⏮️⏭️ sound quality is good.

33,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
34,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"
35,4.2 out of 5,"This is my honest review after using it for 20 days, in this price range it is best one,the only problem i faced was the ear pain, couldn't wear it for more than 2 minutes, its too much tight, so i made it loose by putting it on my book for 48 hours, rest is good, price, sound, clarity, bass and wire length."
36,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

39,3.5 out of 5," I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
40,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
41,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
42,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
43,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
44,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
45,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
46,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
47,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

49,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
50,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
51,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
52,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
53,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
54,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
61,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"
62,4.2 out of 5,"This is my honest review after using it for 20 days, in this price range it is best one,the only problem i faced was the ear pain, couldn't wear it for more than 2 minutes, its too much tight, so i made it loose by putting it on my book for 48 hours, rest is good, price, sound, clarity, bass and wire length."
63,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."
64,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.

65,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."

 I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
67,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
68,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
69,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
70,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
71,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
72,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
73,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
74,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

76,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
77,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
78,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
79,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
80,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
81,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
91,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."
92,3.5 out of 5," I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
93,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
94,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
95,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
96,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
97,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
98,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
99,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
100,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

102,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
103,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
104,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
105,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
106,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
107,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

113,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.

4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."

122,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
123,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
124,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
125,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
126,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
127,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

128,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point.

129,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
130,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
131,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
132,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
133,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
134,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

139,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
140,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"

142,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

144,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."
145,3.5 out of 5," I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
146,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225.

Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of.

149,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.

battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

154,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
155,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
156,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
157,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.

159,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
160,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

166,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
167,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"

169,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

 I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
173,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
174,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
175,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best

177,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
178,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months.

Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
187,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

192,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
193,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"

195,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

197,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."
198,3.5 out of 5," I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
199,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
200,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
201,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
202,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
203,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
204,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
205,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
206,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

208,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
209,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
210,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."

Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."

Sound quality⏮️⏭️ sound quality is good.
Works well for soft and melody songs with my personal experience.

219,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
220,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"
221,4.2 out of 5,"This is my honest review after using it for 20 days, in this price range it is best one,the only problem i faced was the ear pain, couldn't wear it for more than 2 minutes, its too much tight, so i made it loose by putting it on my book for 48 hours, rest is good, price, sound, clarity, bass and wire length."
222,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

224,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."

 I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
226,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
227,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
228,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
229,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
230,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
231,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
232,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
233,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

235,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
236,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
237,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
238,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
239,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
240,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :

● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.

COMFORT :

● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :

I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
246,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"
247,4.2 out of 5,"This is my honest review after using it for 20 days, in this price range it is best one,the only problem i faced was the ear pain, couldn't wear it for more than 2 minutes, its too much tight, so i made it loose by putting it on my book for 48 hours, rest is good, price, sound, clarity, bass and wire length."
248,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."
249,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

250,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."
251,3.5 out of 5," I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
252,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
253,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
254,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
255,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
256,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
257,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
258,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
259,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

261,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
262,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
263,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
264,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
265,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
266,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
277,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."

 I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
279,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
280,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
281,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
282,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
283,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
284,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
285,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
286,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

288,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
289,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
290,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
291,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
292,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
293,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

298,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.

And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."

307,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
308,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.

310,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
311,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
312,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

313,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point.

314,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
315,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
316,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
317,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
318,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
319,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

325,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
326,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"

328,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
338,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
339,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

340,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
341,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
342,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
343,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
344,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
345,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
346,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

351,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
352,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"

354,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

356,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."
357,3.5 out of 5," I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
358,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
359,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

361,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point.

362,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
363,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"

Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."

Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.

Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
372,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

378,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
379,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

381,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

383,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."

 I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
385,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
386,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
387,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
388,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
389,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
390,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
391,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
392,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

394,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"

404,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
405,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"

407,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

409,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."
410,3.5 out of 5," I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
411,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
412,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
413,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
414,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
415,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
416,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
417,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
418,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

420,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
421,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
422,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
423,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
424,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
425,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

BUILT QUALITY :

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
432,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"
433,4.2 out of 5,"This is my honest review after using it for 20 days, in this price range it is best one,the only problem i faced was the ear pain, couldn't wear it for more than 2 minutes, its too much tight, so i made it loose by putting it on my book for 48 hours, rest is good, price, sound, clarity, bass and wire length."
434,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."
435,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.

436,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."

 I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
438,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
439,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
440,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
441,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
442,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
443,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
444,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
445,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

447,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
448,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
449,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
450,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
451,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
452,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
462,4.2 out of 5,"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."
463,3.5 out of 5," I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
464,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
465,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

Overall, its worth for money purchase."
466,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
467,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
468,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
469,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
470,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
471,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

473,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
474,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
475,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
476,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
477,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
478,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."

But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees."

 I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment .."
491,4.2 out of 5,"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review....."
492,3.4 out of 5,"The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.

The headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.

493,3.8 out of 5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
494,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
495,4 out of 5,Nice product...👍👍..
496,3.8 out of 5,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
497,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
498,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

499,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point.

If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
500,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
501,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
502,4.7 out of 5,"Very satisfied with the product and best earbuds you can get with affordable price.
The product was received the next day after ordering.
Excellent sound quality and bass is also too good.
Design & look of this product is really very nice.
It is easy to connect with phone and battery backup is unbelievable & fast charging.
HD sound quality with good noise cancellation.
Easily play music for long with a single charge.
Buds case is wonderful and you haven't seen it yet."
503,3.6 out of 5,The Quality And Design of the Earbuds are so good that it should feel like a premium earbuds.The Connectivity of the Earbuds are also super fast.The Sound quality of the Earbuds are also good and loud.Bass is Awesome.Battery Backup was also good.Overall good earbuds at this price point.
504,3.9 out of 5,"First of all its a very good product considering the price.
Sound : 5/5
Bass :5/5
Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass."
505,4.3 out of 5,"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:
Package:
Box contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.

Build Quality:
Headphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.

Sound:
Tried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.
Obviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.
My satisfaction level : 5/5."

510,4.1 out of 5,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
511,4 out of 5,"1. Great value for money
2. 50mm driver delivers good soundstage and clarity
3. Mids 7/10 bass 6/10 highs 9/10
4. Nice comfortable earpads cushion
5. Mic 9/10 good clarity , doesn't pick up fan sound wind noise , head n wire shaking sound !!! Great mic for the price ... and its adjustable as per your need with solid built

Cons: head band could have been better ... this huge headphone doesnt fit properly at bottom of my ears ... due to headband ... tried adjusting, but ok ... its a issue for me but not affect most of them

Great quality and performance for the Price ... 10/10"

513,4.1 out of 5,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

Thank you"
523,3.9 out of 5,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
524,3.8 out of 5,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

525,3.9 out of 5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
526,4.1 out of 5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
527,3.6 out of 5,"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs."
