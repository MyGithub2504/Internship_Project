2,4.4,Awwssmmm worth it
3,4.5,"I bought this monitor after so much research of finding the best 24 inch IPS monitor. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync
Good Response time of 5ms


Cons:

7,4.5,Bloody good looking monitor. Got essential cables. Got at a fantastic price too. Currently playing in PS4 and works like a friggin charm. Movies are look so good. 60fps is more than enough. Speakers are non existent. The design is sooo good. It's sleek af. And it can be tilted so can be adjusted for perfect viewing angles. Best if you can get for around 6.5-7. I got it for 6. Go for it.

11,4.4,"1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.

137,4.2,"1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.
2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.

219,4.4,Bloody good looking monitor. Got essential cables. Got at a fantastic price too. Currently playing in PS4 and works like a friggin charm. Movies are look so good. 60fps is more than enough. Speakers are non existent. The design is sooo good. It's sleek af. And it can be tilted so can be adjusted for perfect viewing angles. Best if you can get for around 6.5-7. I got it for 6. Go for it.
220,4.3,"I bought this monitor after so much research of finding the best 24 inch IPS monitor. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync
Good Response time of 5ms

351,4.4,"1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.
2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.
3. The 75hz refresh rate makes it feel a bit snappier than regular 60hz monitors.

433,4.5,Bloody good looking monitor. Got essential cables. Got at a fantastic price too. Currently playing in PS4 and works like a friggin charm. Movies are look so good. 60fps is more than enough. Speakers are non existent. The design is sooo good. It's sleek af. And it can be tilted so can be adjusted for perfect viewing angles. Best if you can get for around 6.5-7. I got it for 6. Go for it.
434,4.4,"I bought this monitor after so much research of finding the best 24 inch IPS monitor. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync
Good Response time of 5ms

2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.

564,4.4,"1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.
2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.

646,4.3,Bloody good looking monitor. Got essential cables. Got at a fantastic price too. Currently playing in PS4 and works like a friggin charm. Movies are look so good. 60fps is more than enough. Speakers are non existent. The design is sooo good. It's sleek af. And it can be tilted so can be adjusted for perfect viewing angles. Best if you can get for around 6.5-7. I got it for 6. Go for it.
647,4.5,"I bought this monitor after so much research of finding the best 24 inch IPS monitor. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync
Good Response time of 5ms


Cons:

it is actually lcd moniter with led backlight, when black. colour comes on screen it looks too darker like almoded display"
650,4.2,"1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.
2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.
3. The 75hz refresh rate makes it feel a bit snappier than regular 60hz monitors.
4. The thin bezels gives it a modern look."

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync

797,4.6,"1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.
2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.
3. The 75hz refresh rate makes it feel a bit snappier than regular 60hz monitors.

882,4.1,"1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.
2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.

2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.
3. The 75hz refresh rate makes it feel a bit snappier than regular 60hz monitors.
4. The thin bezels gives it a modern look."
969,4.5,Good
970,4.4,"Monitor is better then I expected!!!!

- Brightness is on point.

- Screen size is big enough to get your work done.

- Some times it lags if I use second screen as the projection mode but other than everything seems fine.

- The design is sleek and elegant and takes less space. Easy to install stand and setup provided in the back to accommodate wires."
971,4.5,"Good for the price with 10% discount.

Just a day of usage and it seems pretty good for the price. Colours and details are good. Blue light feature helps to reduce some eye strain.

Nowadays we are used see full hd resolution in just 6 inch phone display so it is(Full HD Resolution) obviously not enough for 27inch monitor.

Games or movies whatever it is it's just pops out so pleasing to the eyes that you'll forget time. My purpose for buying this was to play games on it. Previously I was using Dell S2216h. That was great too but was missing the 144hz magic. So after ""GOOGLE-ING"" for 4 months I gave rest to my mind and ordered this at an attractive price of 17499 (to complete my gaming rig).

1003,4.3,"I bought this monitor after so much research of finding the best 24 inch IPS monitor. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync
Good Response time of 5ms


Cons:

1006,4.6,"It's a very good product has good clarity, adequate refresh rate and is pretty reasonable priced. I want to specifically mention that though this does not have height adjustment,but INCLUDES TILT ADJUSTMENT. Please check for screws in the cavity of the notch in the stand you are attaching to the back of the monitor.,( They are under a black tape sometimes) else everything is worth the money"
1007,4.1,Bloody good looking monitor. Got essential cables. Got at a fantastic price too. Currently playing in PS4 and works like a friggin charm. Movies are look so good. 60fps is more than enough. Speakers are non existent. The design is sooo good. It's sleek af. And it can be tilted so can be adjusted for perfect viewing angles. Best if you can get for around 6.5-7. I got it for 6.
