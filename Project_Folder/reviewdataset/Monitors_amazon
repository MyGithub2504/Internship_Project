0,4.4 out of 5,"If you're the kind of person who is using it for watching movies(especially at night), for casual gaming, and for general purpose usage, this is the best 27"" monitor that you can find under 10k

Regarding the VA panel, the colours are punchy, ink-y blacks with zero backlight bleed and viewing angles are decent to good.. I doubt you'll get the same level of blacks and contrast on an IPS panel at this price point let alone 27 inches

And yes, the ppi is terrible and is very noticeable while doing my office work, but setting the scale to 110% masks it to some extend and it's the only tradeoff you got to make in this panel.. and considering a 2k panel for slightly better sharpness is over 2x the price of this, it's simply not worth it.

Also, this is not colour accurate or HDR compliant nor has HRR but for a general user, these compromises are acceptable for the price you're getting it. Also, it does not have inbuilt speakers and anyone who has a monitor with inbuilt speakers won't even consider it as a con as they're usually very feeble

Overall, I'd recommend this monitor over any other 24"" monitor available at this price category just for the sheer VFM and quality panel that it offers

And for people thinking about viewing angles as this is not IPS, check out the Lizard pic that I have attached in 3 different angles and trust me, it's not bad and it's definitely a great tradeoff for the deep blacks and zero backlight bleed that it shows head-on which no IPS panel in this price or even 2 levels higher cannot match. Also to note the fact that the monitor will be viewed head-on (+ or - 10 degrees) 95% of the time"

4,4.3 out of 5,"due to COVID - 19 my office instructed to WFH for few weeks and I need an office like setup at home for my busy workday. Bought couple of these monitors and an Amazon Basics dual monitor stand for mounting these monitors. The whole setup compliments my office desk.

Pros:
- Matty finish (good for programming / development use)
- 75Hz refresh rate
- LED backlight (night time you can some light bleeding, but during day time / under proper light no difference)
- VA Panel (no details about VA / IPS panel either in the documentation or Samsung website)
- Colour reproduction is awesome
- Mount option available
- Frameless Design (looks great)

Cons:
- No Audio out port (as mentioned by others). You can't use it for other use cases (like tv)
- Limited connectivity options (no DVI / DisplayLink port), only HDMI or VGA
- VGA resolution is not good when on MAC (I tested Mac Book Pro only, don't know about others). HDMI is recommended

Need to check the durability."

8,4.4 out of 5,"The problem is in the picture clarity. The left half is absolutely excellent but not on the other side, some yellowish color which dulls the monitor. Have called LG Customer care for service and awaiting his presence to sort out this issue. If not I will soon return the product.

Update: The service person convincing that it is nature quality of the light reflected which appears in white background. Yes, couldn't able to find any yellowish while playing videos. But, still it looks awkward. I usually work with white background software where I do not prefer this rile thing. I'm returning this LG monitor. Thanks to LG and Amazon for this awful experience.

Replaced Product Update: Now Amazon making me not to buy their products.
1. Seal is broken and revamped.
2. There is a bulge/ bump in the frame of the screen.
Returning this frustrating product. And I want my money back.
I think this is my last purchase from Amazon.
@Amazon, Don't play with LG brand, LG has lost one loyal customer because of you."

I have a YouTube channel: KTNTECH (You'll find the unboxing and impressions video there)
If you're a gamer do not go with this one.
Because it's an IPS Panel the response times are a lil less and there are tad bit jelly effect while gaming.
If you're a photo/video editor definitely this is for you at least on this budget.

20,4.4 out of 5,"The below reviews are based on my usage after approximately 1 month & have included some comparisons with my other monitor Acer RT240Y(the left monitor is Acer in my photos), as both are similarly priced. Please note that this is a 2020 model for Dell, and mine was manufactured in March 2020. It comes in the box with HDMI cable, so that is a good thing for plug & play!

Pros:
1) This is E2420HS which the seller provides,which actually is supposedly a costlier model than E2420H, which is a good thing!
2) Loved the height adjustment for the monitor (can be seen in the photos) which I don't get in my other monitor RT240Y. I liked this!
3) Speaker of this monitor is surprisingly good! Of course,it does not have enough bass or anything for music playback, but for Skype, usual content, movie watching etc this should do very well.
4) Packing for this model from seller is absolutely top quality!

Cons:
1) NO 3.5mm audio jack for the monitor. So can't connect to ext. speaker (I have that in RT240Y, so I like it better in this feature)
2) The screen seems to be less vibrant with a bit over flashy white in terms of colour output. Liked it better on my RT240Y
3) This is mostly nitpicking, but the monitor swirls sideways on the stand. I wanted the entire unit more Sturdy if possible

Overall, a good buy & I can definitely recommend. I am super surprised on the speaker quality for this monitor so that overcomes all cons for me personally."

28,4.5 out of 5,"I'm a full time Developer and I needed a bigger screen because staring at small texts all day long on a 15inch screen is not good enough and it strains my eyes.
Earlier i was considering 24inch of the same model but the price difference was of 4k INR and i did not find it worth but still i had doubts in my mind that whether i made a mistake or what. But once i got this product and i set it up, I'm telling you guyz, it is just awesome and for programmers I don't think that 4k is worth. That 2 inch difference is not something that you could notice. Infact, after using this 22 inch monitor, i think 1080 is the best resolution, and going 24 or 27 is overkill and you could see the pixels in the screen. So, if you are buying a FHD monitor, 22 inch is the best size you should go for, 24 and 27 inch is best for 1440 resolution.
Not only for programmers, if you a media consumer then this is a great choice at this price.

48,4.5 out of 5,"The monitor looked great when i opened it out from the box. Setting the stand up was so simple, no tools required. It came with the VGA cable, HDMI Cable, power cord, installation disks. I connected the monitor to the power socket and the monitor turned on. There were several big cracks on the screen. It was very disappointing to look at. I connected to the computer anyway to check. But the cracks still remained. Setting up the monitor as a external monitor to my vaio laptop was also very easy using the HDMI cable. Just go to screen resolution option from control panel and select Use the external monitor as primary display. But the cracked screen is a big disappointment. I have placed request for a replacement. Hope the replacement is good.
Edit1: I got a replacement monitor. Which has been working absolutely perfect so far. The replacement process was hassle free."

52,4.3 out of 5,"To start, this is the one of the best gaming monitor, response times at 60hz and 170hz are excellent no ghosting and overshoot if you choose 'picture quality' mode.

This monitor has a huge issue, that's BGR sub pixel layout, which makes text so blurry which hurt your eyes. Windows cleartext helps but there are many program which does not support cleartext as a result text appears blurry, especially in grey background, which is also know as dark mode.

My friend and I bought this monitor and we both experienced dead pixels and weird yellow light bleeding from both bottom ends, we replaced them and observed similar yellow light in replacement models too. People on reddit are also talking about this issue. You can refer to the images. Gigabyte's Quality control seems to be very bad or they are knowingly shipping these faulty units in India. All of the units were manufactured in Nov 2020. Why are they selling 8+ months old products? Something does not seems right here .

As like most of the users I want monitor not only for gaming but for normal browsing, office work (9 hours a day), watching web/TV series and movies. So I can't compromise on such basic things after paying 33k. I refunded the monitor at the end and went for MSI Optix MAG274QRF."

56,3.6 out of 5,"I was looking for a monitor with higher refresh rate, IPS panel, Height adjustment, then I got confused between Acer Nitro, Samsung Odyssey, MSI and Gigabyte. Gigabyte is the only one that gives height adjustment at this price as I have shown in the image.

The monitor I received had no issues of dead pixel, the height adjustment is awesome. I got the monitor for approx 15k with festival and other discounts. It has a little warm colors compared to my LG 24"" which is on the right side in the images, but it is bearable.

Few people have received damaged monitors and that is definitely the mistake of seller or improper handling by delivery person.

I would recommend this monitor to others but yes, do proper checkup when you receive it as many are getting defective product. The monitor itself is awesome.

Forgot to mention that they also include Display port cable in this package, that cable itself costs 500-600 INR. Other brands doesn't include."

The Speakers are really good for monitor speakers.
HDR works as advertised.
FHD in 29 inches is not enough. I'm able to see individual pixels though and movies are not sharp.
I think this is relatively not popular model, as I couldn't find the Softwares and Drivers in LG website for this monitor.
When contacted, they provided drivers of other monitor to use for this monitor..
To conclude, just don't see Youtuber's setup video and buy an ultrawide monitor.
You can always buy two 22 inch best monitors for this price and use as Dual screen. Believe me this isn't worth for normal users."

I feels like my eye got some problem but it is in this monitor you feel .Its not for content creater or watching movie as well. I planed to return this and take my money back."
96,4.1 out of 5,"I have purchased this monitor for my personal use and fulfilling my long time fantasy of owning a beautiful sweet rig. My observations and thoughts on this panel, I have shared below.

34"", Curved, 21:9, 3440x1440, IPS Display
------------------------------------------------------------------
This size in particular, and the fact that it is curved, makes it a brilliant monitor to use as it covers your complete field of view. The resolution is plentiful, providing a whole lot of real estate, and so far I've used 5 windows simultaneously, comfortably. That included 2 Excel Documents, Visual Studio, WebEx (call) and Mattermost (chat).

Additional benefits (I use Citrix), the remote desktop clients actually consume lesser data and run smoother. Yeah, because the way these remote desktop clients is by sending data about things that have changed on the screen. And since you are not minimizing and switching windows around that much, it ends up consuming less data than a regular 1080p monitor.

The color reproduction is great, covers the sRGB scale completely (as per official specs), which makes it great for use in Photography, Cinematography and design work. Note that I would not recommend a curved screen to people who work with straight lines (like AutoCAD, and other such kinds of design softwares and tools).

Simply, a very clean and clear image, I do not see any uneven lighting or backlight bleeding on this display. The display angles are really good, and is extremely comfortable to use. No eye strain noticed either.

Peak brightness is 300 Nits, which I've found more than adequate for use in my room. Most of the time during the day, I find myself using the screen at about 40-50% brightness, and at night I bring it down to 5-10% brightness.

HDR
-------
This is an 8-bit + FRC panel, and is not a true 10-bit HDR display. While it does support HDR, I haven't had a chance to notice the difference as significantly, tried playing some HDR youtube videos, which look fantastic as it is, need to try some true 10-bit HDR videos. For some reason, Windows 10 shows me the display as HDR compatible when I've connected with USB-C but not when using the DisplayPort. It's probably a thing with my laptop itself, my personal laptop being a little older. Will update this section whenever I have more information on this.

100 Hz
------------
Runs really smooth, especially a huge step up coming from a 60 Hz display. Beyond this refresh rate would also be smoother, but not as perceivable. I ain't a hardcore or a professional gamer, so 100Hz felt like a great improvement even over the games that I usually play.

Even supports full 4k signal
--------------------------------------------
Not much to say here, it just does, adding the fact here. Of course it's not the native resolution and doesn't look too great. Probably useful if you plan on plugging in a Fire Stick or something.

1 ms MPRT
-------------------
Motion Picture Response Time is what MPRT is, for the curious. What it does is reduce ghosting or trailing of images on the screen. For example, moving your mouse around on the screen, you will generally see a smooth trail of the mouse behind it, fading out. With MPRT turned on, that trail is just a single ghost image, drastically improving perception of movement generally in games. I tested this on CS:GO, and I could definitely see the difference. In case you want to test it too, just search for UFO Display Test on the web.

Freesync
--------------
This monitor does support FreeSync, which works natively with AMD cards, and works with Nvidia 10 series and onwards. I could not test this, since mine is a GTX970M. Note that FreeSync cannot be used in conjunction with HDR or MPRT. For that, you will have to look for FreeSync 2 models of G-Sync Ultimate. Both of which are much much more expensive than this monitor.

Shower Lights
-----------------------
What I'm talking about, is that this monitor also has ambient lighting under the monitor, and it looks glorious! The only things, is that I only liked the white and the red modes. Very selective colors are available (white, blue, red, orange, green). It is not RGB, does not sync with the display, but the light does looks beautiful. There are certain modes too, like fixed, breathing, flashing, and ripple. Ripple is nice, but only to just show off, it is distracting otherwise. Fixed looks pleasant. Others are just, there. Some more customisability would have just made it amazing. Also the light isn't continuous, but interleaved, so anything reflective under the monitor may not look good, but if you have a non backlit keyboard like mine, it does help shower some light on the keyboard too, a very subtle but neat effect!

Stand and overall look
-----------------------------------
This monitor is simply gorgeous to look at, all the details are sharp and neat, the stand is really, really sexy, but does take up a lot of desk space. Amazing adjustability, height, tilt, swivel, everything can be adjusted, and very effortlessly so. Extremely smooth motion and gives all the feel of a premium product, that you would expect out of it. The monitor is compatible with a VESA 100mm mount, and does come with the mount adapter. In case you want to mount it, you need to get the wall section separately.

Connectivity
--------------------
This monitor has quite a good deal of inputs- 2 HDMI 2.0 ports, 1 DisplayPort 1.2 and one USB Type-C in. This monitor comes with a 180W power brick, and can easily charge your laptop too, all with a single USB-C cable. Makes for an extremely clean setup. Using the USB Type-C in, you get access to 4 USB 3.0 ports at the back of the monitor, that you can make use of. In my setup, one comes to the RGB mat, one to the webcam, one to my comms headphones and one I have vacant. The mouse and keyboard receivers I plug in to the source that I'm using directly instead of the monitor, mainly because the source I change occasionally (between my work and personal laptop). In case you have multiple laptops that can make use of the USB Type-C, it makes sense to plug it behind the monitor directly.

One quirk is the input ports, that are a bit difficult to plug in to. Anyhow, those are set once, and everything happens on the other end, so not much to complain about.

Conclusion
------------------
Overall, this monitor just ticks all the right boxes, violates none. It is a beautiful display to look at and work with, rendering the display beautifully, evenly and smoothly. Lots and lots of real estate make this highly recommendable, and you should definitely avoid 1080p ultrawides if your objective is productivity. That resolution barely adds 1.3 times the real estate as a normal 1080p display. For the price, this is a mid-tier monitor (but really expensive generally for the Indian consumers). Of course, you would go for this monitor only if your work would really benefit from owning such a monitor, or you are a gaming enthusiast, or you just have a lot of money to splurge and don't know what else to do with it. Anyhow, this is a great purchase, and makes for a superb purchase, and one damn beautiful upgrade for your rig. Also to be noted, is that this monitor comes with a 3-year warranty, which for a purchase of this cadre, is a must. Having used Acer monitors in the past, and for this recent purchase of mine, I can highly recommend this."

100,4.2 out of 5,"This review is for the 28 inch 4k CB282K. Been using it for 2 days so far and its a reeeeallly good display. Blacks are as deep as you can expect from an IPS display - very minimal backlight bleed (unnoticeable 99% of the time) and excellent colour accuracy all around. It came supplied with a colour calibration data from the factory with delta E less than 2 but they failed to mention what mode (sRGB? USER? Standard?) mode they calibrate under. Even without custom calibration with a Spyder or a Colormunki the colours are to the T when compared with my other calibrated monitor. sRGB does look a bit off though - slightly washed out and oversaturated. HDR isn't great but one can only expect so much from a 300 nit peak brightness and edge lit display. Still does add a solid punch to HDR games / videos though when activated in Windows. The speakers - just mute them off and do yourself a favour.

Overall a solid buy if you don't mind the lack of usb ports. Would highly recommend - especially at a steal price of 27000₹

Update : Calibrating the monitor with a Spyder Elite gives me a delta E of around 1.4 with an excellent 2.2 gamma. Colours are mostly on point but for red, black and green which shift off more than delta E of 2 but still lesser than 3

Update : It's been over a year now and the monitor works just as good as it did when I bought it"

It came supplied with a colour calibration data from the factory with delta E less than 2 but they failed to mention what mode (sRGB? USER? Standard?) mode they calibrate under. Even without custom calibration with a Spyder or a Colormunki the colours are to the T when compared with my other calibrated monitor. sRGB does look a bit off though - slightly washed out and oversaturated. HDR isn't great but one can only expect so much from a 300 nit peak brightness and edge lit display. Still does add a solid punch to HDR games / videos though when activated in Windows. The speakers - just mute them off and do yourself a favour.

Overall a solid buy if you don't mind the lack of usb ports. Would highly recommend - especially at a steal price of 27000₹

Update : Calibrating the monitor with a Spyder Elite gives me a delta E of around 1.4 with an excellent 2.2 gamma. Colours are mostly on point but for red, black and green which shift off more than delta E of 2 but still lesser than 3

Update : It's been over a year now and the monitor works just as good as it did when I bought it"

And yes, the ppi is terrible and is very noticeable while doing my office work, but setting the scale to 110% masks it to some extend and it's the only tradeoff you got to make in this panel.. and considering a 2k panel for slightly better sharpness is over 2x the price of this, it's simply not worth it.

Also, it does not have inbuilt speakers and anyone who has a monitor with inbuilt speakers won't even consider it as a con as they're usually very feeble

Pros:
1) This is E2420HS which the seller provides,which actually is supposedly a costlier model than E2420H, which is a good thing!
2) Loved the height adjustment for the monitor (can be seen in the photos) which I don't get in my other monitor RT240Y. I liked this!
3) Speaker of this monitor is surprisingly good! Of course,it does not have enough bass or anything for music playback, but for Skype, usual content, movie watching etc this should do very well.
4) Packing for this model from seller is absolutely top quality!

Cons:
1) NO 3.5mm audio jack for the monitor. So can't connect to ext. speaker (I have that in RT240Y, so I like it better in this feature)
2) The screen seems to be less vibrant with a bit over flashy white in terms of colour output. Liked it better on my RT240Y

124,4.5 out of 5,"Before i start with the in depth review, let me state that this is actually the best 2k 144hz IPS monitor you can buy for 32k in India, And i would give it a 9/10.

Those who wanna know more can continue reading.

We will divide the review in a few sections :

1) Introduction and some background :
===============================
Acer's Nitro series is not their flagship series and as such they tend to omit some features and keep the advertisement and branding to a minimal for this range.

Nitro series is targeted towards more budget oriented gamers and till now they have done a good job at providing good peripherals for cheap.

Now i am not trying to say that Nitro series can go toe to toe with their Predator series lineup, but fortunately for us gamers this time it seems like this particular monitor is actually a better product overall than the Predator XB271HU which costs around 50k.

2) Picture Quality/Panel Quality :
==========================
This monitor uses an IPS panel made by INNOLUX(OEM) which is also found in the much costlier Aorus AD27QD.
The panel boasts of very high brightness in excess of 400 nits. It also boasts of a wide color gamut exceeding 95% DCI P3 coverage. Both of these things combined certify this monitor to carry the HDR400 moniker.

The monitor has a nominal response time of about 6-7 ms which is actually not the best for an IPS but gets the job done considering you need each frame delivered every 6-7 ms for a monitor to be able to display 144 frames per second. Along with being 144hz capable the monitor also comes equipped with Freesync and i am happy to report that GSYNC does work with this monitor. Freesync Range is limited to 48hz to 144hz so it also support LFC(Low Framerate Compensation), google it if you want to know more, it's quite an interesting feature to have :)

Specs aside, i think the monitor's color calibration out of the box is not that great but the OSD offers a lot of options to tweak color, gamma, brightness, contrast as well as hue and saturation of 6 basic colors, meaning you can calibrate it to your liking if need be without much hassle. Although it needs to be noted that the seeded SRGB emulation mode is quite restrictive and offers very little in the way of tweaking. So i advice against using that.

I really enjoyed this display, the colors after a bit of tinkering are very well saturated and true to life, in fact the colors are much better here than on the Predator XB271HU which has a limited color gamut. The Contrast ratio too is above 1100:1 which is great for an IPS panel.

The monitor also supports Overdrive and backlight strobing and inserts a solid color frame in between pixel transitions to increase the pixel responsiveness substantially and the difference between using it without backlight strobing and with is quite apparent that if your eyes can take it, since the backlight strobing is a little hard on eyes. But having this feature is anyday better than not having it.

It's also crazy how good this panel is in terms of backlight bleed, i have attached a few pics showcasing that, and yes i know backlight bleed can vary from panel to panel, but researching a little bit over the internet and taking feedback from other owners, i can firmly conclude that this INNOLUX panel is much less prone to backlight bleed than the AU Optronics panel which is currently the most widely used 2k 144hz panel(Acer Predator, Asus ROG)

Pretty sure you guys can fathom by now that this monitor checks a lot of boxes :
Freesync/G SYNC compatible - Check
Barely any Backlight Bleed - Check
Wide Color Gamut - Check
High Contrast and Brightness - Check
IPS panel - Check
144hz - Check
Backlight Strobing - Check
Can accept HDR input - Check
Don't have to sell a kidney to buy it - Check

3) Build and Accessories:
====================
It's surprisingly well built, and looks pretty similar to the Predator XB271HU with its slim to non existent bezels(Except at the bottom).

To control the OSD we have an intuitive joystick at the back which is a welcome change and makes navigating the OSD a breeze. Well talking about OSD reminds me of how many options it has for tweaking everything from brightness to freesync to colors, unfortunately describing each setting here is an exercise in futility, since all these details are available in their official documentation. So unless there is something out of the ordinary, i will not be bringing it up.

The stand accompanied with this monitor is probably the biggest sore point, it only offers minimal tilt and it's not a very pleasant experience, but considering the price i guess that's a necessary sacrifice, on the plus side though, you can go out and buy a quality VESA arm for 3-5k(Yes this monitor has VESA compatible mount at the back)

Lest i forget, it needs to be mentioned that G SYNC is only supported when using a Display Port cable and this monitor only comes with an HDMI cable, so folks with an NVIDIA GPU make sure you order a Display Port 1.4 cable along with it.

4) Conclusion :
============
Well this is tricky, i have already proclaimed that this is the best monitor you can buy under 60k, while it only costs 32k, which means i am saying indirectly that this is better than any monitor under 60k, which should be taken with a pinch of salt. Let me explain :

Monitors like Predator and ROG cost a lot more not just because they are the flagship offerings and they don't want to dilute their respective brands but also because they carry G SYNC modules and are certified by Nvidia, meaning they have best in class pixel response times and best in class input lag. While this VG271U has non existent input lag, it does have an average pixel response time and doesn't have the G SYNC module.

For some us these would be crucial but i think from a more critical perspective these are things which should not matter as much unless you are a Pro Gamer but even then i have to ask, how many pro gamers actually use a 2k monitor, because 2k is not an easy resolution to run, it requires beefy GPU to push those frames at 2k. And it is because of this i don't think the aforementioned drawbacks are a deal breaker for 90% of us and it's an acceptable sacrifice to get such a great monitor at 32k.

Hope i made myself clear, if not you are welcome to pose a question in the comments section.

4) Misc. Stuff :
============

In this section i want to talk about 2 controversial topics, HDR400 and Flickering.
Let's start with flickering, as some users have reported flickering is a real issue with some of the panels, if you google you can see you are not alone and other users have had this issues as well, but there are 2 types of people reporting this flickering problem here and a clear distinction needs to be made :

A. People having flickering out of the box while using Freesync : This is clearly a panel defect and you can ask Amazon or Acer to get a replacement, most users have this problem resolved after getting the replacement.

B. People having flickering while using the freesync with nvidia cards(G SYNC) : This could be a defect and could also be due to the fact that this monitor is not officially in the Nvidia's G SYNC compatible list, So you would be lucky if the manufacturer provided you a replacement which works, but it is not something you can contest. Luckily for me my panel works very well with G SYNC and there is no flickering, your mileage may vary.

If your panel is within the amazon's replacement period, i suggest you go for it.

Now let's talk about HDR400, most of you must be aware that without any form of local dimming, you cannot really boost the contrast ratio which is critical for a good HDR experience and that's also the reason why good HDR TV's and monitors are so costly, as they have to implement multi-zone backlight systems which are quite expensive. While this monitor does come with HDR400 certification , the certification itself is somewhat pointless since the HDR400 standard is pretty weak. It is not to say that HDR400 doesn't improve image quality for HDR enabled content, but all i am trying to say is keep your expectations in check, the best this monitor will do is crank the brightness to 400+ nits and provide better colors while using HDR mode, the main advantage here is getting better colors but not a better HDR experience which heavily relies on super high Contrast Ratio.

That's it folks, not sure if i missed anything, but for now this concludes my review."

The monitor also supports Overdrive and backlight strobing and inserts a solid color frame in between pixel transitions to increase the pixel responsiveness substantially and the difference between using it without backlight strobing and with is quite apparent that if your eyes can take it, since the backlight strobing is a little hard on eyes. But having this feature is anyday better than not having it.

It's also crazy how good this panel is in terms of backlight bleed, i have attached a few pics showcasing that, and yes i know backlight bleed can vary from panel to panel, but researching a little bit over the internet and taking feedback from other owners, i can firmly conclude that this INNOLUX panel is much less prone to backlight bleed than the AU Optronics panel which is currently the most widely used 2k 144hz panel(Acer Predator, Asus ROG)

Pretty sure you guys can fathom by now that this monitor checks a lot of boxes :
Freesync/G SYNC compatible - Check
Barely any Backlight Bleed - Check
Wide Color Gamut - Check
High Contrast and Brightness - Check
IPS panel - Check
144hz - Check
Backlight Strobing - Check
Can accept HDR input - Check
Don't have to sell a kidney to buy it - Check

3) Build and Accessories:
====================
It's surprisingly well built, and looks pretty similar to the Predator XB271HU with its slim to non existent bezels(Except at the bottom).

To control the OSD we have an intuitive joystick at the back which is a welcome change and makes navigating the OSD a breeze. Well talking about OSD reminds me of how many options it has for tweaking everything from brightness to freesync to colors, unfortunately describing each setting here is an exercise in futility, since all these details are available in their official documentation. So unless there is something out of the ordinary, i will not be bringing it up.

The stand accompanied with this monitor is probably the biggest sore point, it only offers minimal tilt and it's not a very pleasant experience, but considering the price i guess that's a necessary sacrifice, on the plus side though, you can go out and buy a quality VESA arm for 3-5k(Yes this monitor has VESA compatible mount at the back)

Lest i forget, it needs to be mentioned that G SYNC is only supported when using a Display Port cable and this monitor only comes with an HDMI cable, so folks with an NVIDIA GPU make sure you order a Display Port 1.4 cable along with it.

4) Conclusion :
============
Well this is tricky, i have already proclaimed that this is the best monitor you can buy under 60k, while it only costs 32k, which means i am saying indirectly that this is better than any monitor under 60k, which should be taken with a pinch of salt. Let me explain :

Monitors like Predator and ROG cost a lot more not just because they are the flagship offerings and they don't want to dilute their respective brands but also because they carry G SYNC modules and are certified by Nvidia, meaning they have best in class pixel response times and best in class input lag. While this VG271U has non existent input lag, it does have an average pixel response time and doesn't have the G SYNC module.

For some us these would be crucial but i think from a more critical perspective these are things which should not matter as much unless you are a Pro Gamer but even then i have to ask, how many pro gamers actually use a 2k monitor, because 2k is not an easy resolution to run, it requires beefy GPU to push those frames at 2k. And it is because of this i don't think the aforementioned drawbacks are a deal breaker for 90% of us and it's an acceptable sacrifice to get such a great monitor at 32k.

Hope i made myself clear, if not you are welcome to pose a question in the comments section.

4) Misc. Stuff :
============

In this section i want to talk about 2 controversial topics, HDR400 and Flickering.
Let's start with flickering, as some users have reported flickering is a real issue with some of the panels, if you google you can see you are not alone and other users have had this issues as well, but there are 2 types of people reporting this flickering problem here and a clear distinction needs to be made :

A. People having flickering out of the box while using Freesync : This is clearly a panel defect and you can ask Amazon or Acer to get a replacement, most users have this problem resolved after getting the replacement.

B. People having flickering while using the freesync with nvidia cards(G SYNC) : This could be a defect and could also be due to the fact that this monitor is not officially in the Nvidia's G SYNC compatible list, So you would be lucky if the manufacturer provided you a replacement which works, but it is not something you can contest. Luckily for me my panel works very well with G SYNC and there is no flickering, your mileage may vary.

If your panel is within the amazon's replacement period, i suggest you go for it.

Now let's talk about HDR400, most of you must be aware that without any form of local dimming, you cannot really boost the contrast ratio which is critical for a good HDR experience and that's also the reason why good HDR TV's and monitors are so costly, as they have to implement multi-zone backlight systems which are quite expensive. While this monitor does come with HDR400 certification , the certification itself is somewhat pointless since the HDR400 standard is pretty weak. It is not to say that HDR400 doesn't improve image quality for HDR enabled content, but all i am trying to say is keep your expectations in check, the best this monitor will do is crank the brightness to 400+ nits and provide better colors while using HDR mode, the main advantage here is getting better colors but not a better HDR experience which heavily relies on super high Contrast Ratio.

That's it folks, not sure if i missed anything, but for now this concludes my review."
126,4.5 out of 5,"Before i start with the in depth review, let me state that this is actually the best 2k 144hz IPS monitor you can buy for 32k in India, And i would give it a 9/10.

Those who wanna know more can continue reading.

We will divide the review in a few sections :

1) Introduction and some background :
===============================
Acer's Nitro series is not their flagship series and as such they tend to omit some features and keep the advertisement and branding to a minimal for this range.

Nitro series is targeted towards more budget oriented gamers and till now they have done a good job at providing good peripherals for cheap.

Now i am not trying to say that Nitro series can go toe to toe with their Predator series lineup, but fortunately for us gamers this time it seems like this particular monitor is actually a better product overall than the Predator XB271HU which costs around 50k.

2) Picture Quality/Panel Quality :
==========================
This monitor uses an IPS panel made by INNOLUX(OEM) which is also found in the much costlier Aorus AD27QD.
The panel boasts of very high brightness in excess of 400 nits. It also boasts of a wide color gamut exceeding 95% DCI P3 coverage. Both of these things combined certify this monitor to carry the HDR400 moniker.

The monitor has a nominal response time of about 6-7 ms which is actually not the best for an IPS but gets the job done considering you need each frame delivered every 6-7 ms for a monitor to be able to display 144 frames per second. Along with being 144hz capable the monitor also comes equipped with Freesync and i am happy to report that GSYNC does work with this monitor. Freesync Range is limited to 48hz to 144hz so it also support LFC(Low Framerate Compensation), google it if you want to know more, it's quite an interesting feature to have :)

Specs aside, i think the monitor's color calibration out of the box is not that great but the OSD offers a lot of options to tweak color, gamma, brightness, contrast as well as hue and saturation of 6 basic colors, meaning you can calibrate it to your liking if need be without much hassle. Although it needs to be noted that the seeded SRGB emulation mode is quite restrictive and offers very little in the way of tweaking. So i advice against using that.

The customer care simply said that the part is not available. Hence, they can't provide refund or monitor replacement.

2. The monitor is not bezel-less, product pictures are misleading. Fool customers with bright looking pictures.
3. Monitor support only 60hz refresh rate @ 1080p and but the description claims this monitor to be full HD 75 Hz monitor.
4. Heavy flickering.

5. Lenovo customer Care is horrible. demand daily followup for even a simple update. but no Solution.

It's a fake warranty. The service centers don't service monitors. And customer care is horrible. Don't waste your money for Lenovo. It's like a sarkari office fooling you day on day on."

- No fuss entry level monitor with a hdmi cable included. Good for plug and play.
- Color reproduction is okay for entry level

What is isn't good
- The marketing hype around thin bezels is misplaced. The bezels are as big as they used to come in 2010s.
- The viewing angle is severely limited. Works when you right in front of the monitor but not you view from obtuse angle. Should be expected from a VA screen. This is not an IPS screen. But the dell website claims 178 degrees viewing angle.
- Comes with default 16A power adapter, the ones used for geysers and heavy appliances."

And best of all they were using VA panel and not TN(which are usually the cheapest and the worst looking).

Before i start my rant about its issues, let me say this, for this price you won't get Freesync and 144hz from any other brand, the blacks are pretty good and the panel gets decently bright.
And overall can be a decent buy if the panel issues are sorted out which i will discuss next.

So despite my apprehensions with this brand and Acer in general, i dived in and bought it, only to realize nothing ever comes cheap, and there is a reason why AOPEN monitors are so cheap, usually with monitors QA(Quality Assurance) plays a big factor when deciding the price. You see the more monitors you have to discard on the assembly line to maintain a certain level of quality, the more end users end up paying for that quality. I think by now you know why these monitors costs to less, for those who didn't get it, the QA department for such cheap monitors is pretty relaxed, they allow relatively bad looking panels to pass through to cut down the price.

For some this might absolutely be a non issue, but for the discerning user who values quality, i will not recommend this monitor, the proof is in front of you folks, the pics i have attached here show how a complete black backgrounnd looks on this monitor, its really funny because my 8 year old TN panel monitor looks way better.

It seems like we should expect less of panels now than we did 8 years ago(Added a comparison screenshot of this monitor vs my 8 year old TN panel, just look at the panel uniformity and backlight difference between the 2) !
The panel uniformity is all over the place, and if you tell me to look the other way due to the price, i won't because even the costlier Predator series monitors have backlight bleed and uniformity issues.

Ok enough talk about the first issue, moving to issue number 2.
Typically and technically IPS panels have the best color reproduction, followed by VA and then TN.
So i was expecting the monitor to have much richer and better colors than my TN panel, but sadly thats not the case, the colors are completely unrealistic, have an unnatural hue, and to add to that the monitor's edges are DIMLY LIT.
Caliberating the monitor on your own helps a bit but its still not a good VA panel.

Pros :
-------
Good Contrast ratio
Intuitive OSD
Decent Build Quality
144hz
Freesync(works with Nvidia gpus too now, but only with pascal and turing)

Cons :
--------
Pathetic backlight issues with dim edges
Really bad color calibration out of the box
Panel uniformity issues

Giving it 2 star due to all of this, because in my eyes a monitor should have a solid foundation(The Panel) and then adding extra features adds value, if your panel is this poor then whats the point in having all those features."

180,4.5 out of 5," First of all It’s the best 1080P 22” 75Hz in it’s price(7500) and I’m saying it after my research based purchase and after purchase experience.

Contents:-
came with Monitor!, 2 piece modular stand, VGA cable, HDMI cable thankfully!, AUX cable nice!, power cord and power brick, some paperwork
*************************
Ports:-
HDMI, VGA, AUX input(can’t be used as output when sound is coming from HDMI), power input
*************************
Looks and feel:-
It’s so different and better looking than those full black monitor and on the inside it’s 75Hz display so it’s a totally different experience inside and out with this monitor, the white portion of this monitor stands out beautifully, the main display is half as thick as a usb plug display is matt finish so it doesn't matter if there’s light source in front of it
*************************
Display:-
Vibrant output, Beautiful color production, No dead pixels and no color bleeding
Some people had issue with color bleeding but not me, supports freesync and capable of 75 FPS output, I haven’t noticed any stain on eyes 10+ continuous hours and I’m a guy with glasses.
It’s a 75 hz display, i’ve used 60Hz display for 11 years and it makes a difference it’s only display in this price range with this feature and sealed the deal for me.
You can game on it no problems just know that this monitor doesn't sell as gaming monitor and gsync and display overclocking support is not available, it has 4 MS response time and is better at gaming than other similar monitors and some expensive monitors too
**********************
Speaker and sound:-
it has 2, 2 watt speakers in the bottom which is not loud at all and lacks basic bass I'm not asking for much just enough, for reference my poco F1 has loud and clear speaker than this dual speaker monitor it’s just there and you shouldn't rely on it but is a nice addition, something is better than nothing
For speaker to work you can give input by HDMI cable and if you are using VGA there’s aux input too
***************************
Manual setting suggestion:-
This is a 75 Hz display so first of all check that your graphics unit has enabled 75Hz from normally 60Hz refresh rate to enjoy it’s full capability
Factory display setting of this monitor was with a warm color to give feelings of blue light protection which was not looking normal so you may have to tweak the settings to fit your needs
***************************
One thing to keep in mind that it’s a 21.5 inch 1080P monitor which has a 102.46 per inch that means if you use it in its native resolution text might be smaller for you, text is totally readable and clear but small so I have custom scaled this monitor to 109% now everything is fine for the monitor but windows OS is bad at scaling some text are blurry like chrome suggestion which is totally not a big deal but something to keep in mind and if you buy 24 inch monitor the price of that is just shy of double the price of this monitor.

If we are talking about eye care than this monitor doesn’t put strain on eyes just set it to comfortable brightness and use a blue light filter like flu.x or use windows 10’s night light feature"
181,4.5 out of 5," First of all It’s the best 1080P 22” 75Hz in it’s price(7500) and I’m saying it after my research based purchase and after purchase experience.

Contents:-
came with Monitor!, 2 piece modular stand, VGA cable, HDMI cable thankfully!, AUX cable nice!, power cord and power brick, some paperwork
*************************
Ports:-
HDMI, VGA, AUX input(can’t be used as output when sound is coming from HDMI), power input
*************************
Looks and feel:-
It’s so different and better looking than those full black monitor and on the inside it’s 75Hz display so it’s a totally different experience inside and out with this monitor, the white portion of this monitor stands out beautifully, the main display is half as thick as a usb plug display is matt finish so it doesn't matter if there’s light source in front of it
*************************
Display:-
Vibrant output, Beautiful color production, No dead pixels and no color bleeding
Some people had issue with color bleeding but not me, supports freesync and capable of 75 FPS output, I haven’t noticed any stain on eyes 10+ continuous hours and I’m a guy with glasses.
It’s a 75 hz display, i’ve used 60Hz display for 11 years and it makes a difference it’s only display in this price range with this feature and sealed the deal for me.
You can game on it no problems just know that this monitor doesn't sell as gaming monitor and gsync and display overclocking support is not available, it has 4 MS response time and is better at gaming than other similar monitors and some expensive monitors too

188,4.4 out of 5,"This LG monitor is very bright. You can turn down brightness to ease viewing. This is a TN monitor so viewing angle is limited, however I found the viewing angles are sufficient for working on a table and doing office work or studying. May not be suitable if you are thinking to buy it for watching videos/movies from bed or sofa etc.
Monitor is sturdy, the buttons work fine you can choose to keep power LED indicator on or off. I have changed it to on, by default off is selected. The VGA cable is ok but power cord is thin. Also the plug is a power adaptor itself, So it takes up more place than an ordinary 3 pin plug. But the monitor stays cool as the power supply board (SMPS) is outside monitor housing.
This is not a HD monitor. It has resolution of only 1366x768. This was a common standard 10 years ago. In 2021 when YT is streaming 1K, 2K, 4K videos this monitor can't make use of those HD videos, as it can show only 720 p videos and all higher resolution videos will not improve quality over 720p. In 2021 a non-HD monitor at 5299/- (I spent) is bit over priced. This is a compromise with viewing quality, similar sized monitor with 1600x900 or higher resolution will have more clearer pictures.
Final verdict is This monitor is suitable for study and office purpose. So, for students and office workers it serves its purpose pretty well.
But, if you have money to spend, then go for a FHD IPS monitors for better picture and video quality, for better and vibrant colour reproductions and for wide viewing angles."

Fortunately it did not damage the monitor inside. Second the packer had sent two power chords - one with 15 AMP Indian plug for a system that consumes 30 Watts power. The second power chord had an American plug. Neither could be used in my work area that has 5 AMP Indian sockets mainly. With an Indian-to-American plug adapter I got the system working. I got the Monitor Driver downloaded from the ViewSonci site that was a zip file. I could extract and install the display driver smoothly. The monitor is now working very well with the QHD resolution of 2560X1440. Any help on finetuning the display settings is welcome."

I have recently bought an Acer31.5 inch monitor (ED322Q). I am facing a lot of backlight bleeding issues. While watching a movie or when the screen is black, I could see a lot of background light noise. I have attached a picture also for your reference.

I would like to request you to please raise a replacement request as my entire work is dependent on this monitor currently. On amazon there is no replacement policy, all I could see is a return option. However, I would not like to return this product at the moment. It would be nice if you can replace the monitor with a new one and do proper quality control before sending a replacement."

2. AMD free sync equipped.
3.Color reproduction is amazing(For video and photo editing purpose.)
4. HDMI 3.0 in this price range(very few other monitor have this),display port and have aux port.
5.Very good and convienient VESA mount(Tilt and vertical adjustment) though not able to rotate,not an issue.

I have bought this for for 15k which was ice on cake😋. But at 16k also not a bad deal.

HP Good Job."

232,4.5 out of 5," I bought two monitors for my home office setup. One from hp and one from Lenovo through amazon of similar spec.. Lenovo product stopped working all of a sudden. I raised a support ticket, they directed me to Lenovo service center which is 2 hours from my location ..

I drove to the store which Lenovo support team asked me to visit .. the store denied warranty support for monitors and directed me to another store.. second store also denied advied me to contact seller from Amazon.. seller from Amazon asked me to get a written confirmation from Lenovo that they are denying warranty .. have wasted two days driving in traffic from store to store to get this two months old product get serviced under warranty..

Update : had to do multiple follow ups with Lenovo customer support. They promised to replace the monitor. But it has been more than a month now and the ticket is still in progress. In my last follow up with my customer support, they gave an estimated time for the replacement to arrive will 15 days ( this is after waiting for 1month).. will update once I receive monitor. But as a customer, this will be my last purchase from Lenovo.

Final update : they replaced my monitor with a refurbished Lenovo L24e-20 va panel .. which is an downgraded model to what I purchased. Don't buy products from Lenovo .. disappointed"

272,4.3 out of 5,"The M5 32"" (₹ 25000) appears to be a bang for the buck over the M7 32"" variant(₹ 37000).
The only two differences being -

1. Screen resolution - 1080P (M5) vs 4K (M7)
2. USB C to C option for 65W charging & connectivity is present in M7 & not in M5.

However the USB C to C cable is not included in the M7 OOTB package for which you will need to shed out another 1000 odd bucks to get the compatible cable and make use of the connectivity option. Huge disappointment on that front.

M5 32"" is still a desirable monitor cum Tv @ ₹ 25000 given the value proposition it offers while M7 falls flat, charging a bomb.

For 37000, you can get a massive 4K HD LED IPS Redmi TV at 55"" against the minuscule 32"" inch 4K HD LED VGA Samsung M7 smart monitor, if you desire for a good TV. If you are just after the monitor & not the TV, 25K M5 variant would suffice more than needed.

Detailed Review :

What's in the box? 🎁

1. 32"" VGA Monitor & a stand with required screws. (Yeah you've seen it right, it's VGA and not IPS)
2. Power Adapter
3. HDMI - HDMI Cable
4. Remote with batteries

What's not? 🚫

USB type C-C cable for 65W charging is NOT included as part of the M7 package and the feature in itself is not available in the M5 32""/27"".

What's great? 😻

1. TV + Monitor all in one interface, pre loaded with the YouTube/Prime/Netflix/Hotstar/Zee5/Apple TV+ apps.

2. Display & visual calibration - Despite being a VGA panel, I've zero complaints on the display quality and the available calibration options. I haven't witnessed any ghosting/black bleeding regardless of the surrounding brightness. Eye Care & Adaptive Display calibration are good & I'm sure with the subsequent software updates, display options and calibrations will only grow from strength to strength.

3. Seamless transition from Tv to Work & back : Thanks to the Tizen OS. All it takes is just a remote click and I'm already loving to swap between the TV & the Work Monitor without much ado or efforts.

4. Remote - The best part of it all. Minimalistic yet effective. This makes the experience so rewarding. Offers the comfort from wherever you are.

5. Audio quality - Oh boy, this blew me off! Nobody would've expected a monitor to perform so well in this area. The Amplification option is ""real loud"" and trust me you won't need to tune beyond 25 so not to invite the fury of your neighbours. Audio quality is exceptionally good given its price range. Hey but, don't expect the Atmos / Bass effect. It does it's job over and above. DOT. It even allows you to pair a bluetooth headset/speaker if in case you need. The BT headphone option for sure helps those late night binge watchers with parents/kids next room.

6. AirPlay support - Perhaps the only non mac monitor to come up with an inbuilt AirPlay support. You can mirror your iOS / MacOs / iPadOs devices with an one time pairing. Works reasonably good although the efficacy lies in the strength of your Wifi.
But make no mistake, the monitor doesn’t support HomePods / HomePods Mini yet for Audio streaming. I wish they enabled this feature. This monitor and HomePods for audio would’ve summed up a quality entertainment.

What's Meh? 😼

1. Tizen/Samsung App Store is still evolving and you won't find a lot of Indian OTT/News apps in there yet. But all the major ones mentioned above are already available.

2. Bixby Voice assistant is still mediocre.

3. Not for ardent gamers. Screen refresh rate tanks at 60Hz.

4. No Ethernet port making it entirely relying on Wifi. So unless you’ve a strong Wifi, you can’t leverage the Tv features much.

5. Wireless screen mirroring has a lag and that’s understandable. However the wireless mirroring supports only the screen refresh rate of 30 Hz against the capable 60 Hz. As well the screen resolution is supported only at 720P / 1080P against the 4K."

USB type C-C cable for 65W charging is NOT included as part of the M7 package and the feature in itself is not available in the M5 32""/27"".

What's great? 😻

1. TV + Monitor all in one interface, pre loaded with the YouTube/Prime/Netflix/Hotstar/Zee5/Apple TV+ apps.

2. Display & visual calibration - Despite being a VGA panel, I've zero complaints on the display quality and the available calibration options. I haven't witnessed any ghosting/black bleeding regardless of the surrounding brightness. Eye Care & Adaptive Display calibration are good & I'm sure with the subsequent software updates, display options and calibrations will only grow from strength to strength.

3. Seamless transition from Tv to Work & back : Thanks to the Tizen OS. All it takes is just a remote click and I'm already loving to swap between the TV & the Work Monitor without much ado or efforts.

4. Remote - The best part of it all. Minimalistic yet effective. This makes the experience so rewarding. Offers the comfort from wherever you are.

5. Audio quality - Oh boy, this blew me off! Nobody would've expected a monitor to perform so well in this area. The Amplification option is ""real loud"" and trust me you won't need to tune beyond 25 so not to invite the fury of your neighbours. Audio quality is exceptionally good given its price range. Hey but, don't expect the Atmos / Bass effect. It does it's job over and above. DOT. It even allows you to pair a bluetooth headset/speaker if in case you need. The BT headphone option for sure helps those late night binge watchers with parents/kids next room.

6. AirPlay support - Perhaps the only non mac monitor to come up with an inbuilt AirPlay support. You can mirror your iOS / MacOs / iPadOs devices with an one time pairing. Works reasonably good although the efficacy lies in the strength of your Wifi.
But make no mistake, the monitor doesn’t support HomePods / HomePods Mini yet for Audio streaming. I wish they enabled this feature. This monitor and HomePods for audio would’ve summed up a quality entertainment.

What's Meh? 😼

1. Tizen/Samsung App Store is still evolving and you won't find a lot of Indian OTT/News apps in there yet. But all the major ones mentioned above are already available.

2. Bixby Voice assistant is still mediocre.

3. Not for ardent gamers. Screen refresh rate tanks at 60Hz.

4. No Ethernet port making it entirely relying on Wifi. So unless you’ve a strong Wifi, you can’t leverage the Tv features much.

5. Wireless screen mirroring has a lag and that’s understandable. However the wireless mirroring supports only the screen refresh rate of 30 Hz against the capable 60 Hz. As well the screen resolution is supported only at 720P / 1080P against the 4K."
274,4.3 out of 5,"The M5 32"" (₹ 25000) appears to be a bang for the buck over the M7 32"" variant(₹ 37000).
The only two differences being -

1. Screen resolution - 1080P (M5) vs 4K (M7)
2. USB C to C option for 65W charging & connectivity is present in M7 & not in M5.

However the USB C to C cable is not included in the M7 OOTB package for which you will need to shed out another 1000 odd bucks to get the compatible cable and make use of the connectivity option. Huge disappointment on that front.

M5 32"" is still a desirable monitor cum Tv @ ₹ 25000 given the value proposition it offers while M7 falls flat, charging a bomb.

For 37000, you can get a massive 4K HD LED IPS Redmi TV at 55"" against the minuscule 32"" inch 4K HD LED VGA Samsung M7 smart monitor, if you desire for a good TV. If you are just after the monitor & not the TV, 25K M5 variant would suffice more than needed.

312,4.5 out of 5,"It's a decent monitor for the price. But the main pros (USP) of this monitor doesn't actually enhance your experience. Here are those features:

- Super Sleek design: I personally wouldn't care if a monitor is sleek or not. It's anyways lying on the desk.
- Light weight: Again, not a feature I would be asking from a monitor.
- Edgeless design: Although this is a major feature for enhancing the experience, the white border below ruins it all for you. It's so distracting. I would've appreciated a black border on the front at least.

Talking about other features:
- Sound quality isn't that appealing. It's ok.
- Screen: It took me a couple of days to get adjusted to the screen picture quality. It's good but I still feel it's not the best.

I previously order Dell 2421H, the readability and sound quality in that monitor are surely better than this. Due to some manufacturing defect I had to return it and later it's price increased way above my budget. So I had to settle for this one.

Drawbacks:
- This monitor doesn't have a wall mount option.
- Also, it stands tilted slightly towards the left. I have read the same opinion from some other reviews as well.

All in all, I would rate it decent in every aspect. No major drawbacks as such, but nothing extraordinary as well."

316,4 out of 5,"Sharp images, vivid colours, responsive monitor. It's a gorgeous IPS panel (anti-glare). This packages a premium experience for a not-so-premium price.

My qualms:

The monitor wobbles a bit when using the buttons, so be mindful of that.

There is a significant amount of IPS glow under low light conditions. If that bothers you, look for a non-IPS panel.

In general:

Ideal for desk usage. Stand won't swivel so usage is restricted to the horizontal mode. You get the standard port setup - 1 VGA, 1 HDMI. It'll get the job done for the average user. I believe it's an 8-bit, so professional photo editing is not the ideal use case.

324,3.9 out of 5,"While going for a monitor and that too for entertainment and WFH purpose, the most important criteria for me is the colors. I checked some monitor at nearby store, but the problem that I see is they looked washed out. Later after going through reviews I came to know monitors are mainly focuses on showing true colors, and therefore while comparing picture quality for ex with a T.V they always looked washed out. I picked this monitor because of it's HDRi feature. In normal cases it works like charm but while watching movies and some videos I quickly turn on HDR mode and all the colors just pop out. However, its not perfect in all scenario. In some cases you might feel like switching off HDR mode is better. A dedicated button for this helps alot in switching HDRi mode.
Another feature that I liked about this monitor is epaper mode, which turn the display into grey-scale mode. This feature helps out while reading books and doesn't put much stress on the eyes. Speaker quality is okay, don't keep your hope high with this speaker, for a reference you can compare the sound quality with a small bluetooth speaker.
Two options are available 24 inch and 27 inch, if you are planning to code, read books frequently go with 24 inch model because you are going to get more PPI and overall text will look sharp. But watching movies and playing game is only requirement then you can prefer 27 inch model as well.
Overall, I am quite happy with the monitor and you can blindly choose this."

Later after going through reviews I came to know monitors are mainly focuses on showing true colors, and therefore while comparing picture quality for ex with a T.V they always looked washed out. I picked this monitor because of it's HDRi feature. In normal cases it works like charm but while watching movies and some videos I quickly turn on HDR mode and all the colors just pop out. However, its not perfect in all scenario. In some cases you might feel like switching off HDR mode is better. A dedicated button for this helps alot in switching HDRi mode.
Another feature that I liked about this monitor is epaper mode, which turn the display into grey-scale mode. This feature helps out while reading books and doesn't put much stress on the eyes. Speaker quality is okay, don't keep your hope high with this speaker, for a reference you can compare the sound quality with a small bluetooth speaker.
Two options are available 24 inch and 27 inch, if you are planning to code, read books frequently go with 24 inch model because you are going to get more PPI and overall text will look sharp. But watching movies and playing game is only requirement then you can prefer 27 inch model as well.
Overall, I am quite happy with the monitor and you can blindly choose this."
328,4.1 out of 5,"I have been using this monitor for almost A YEAR now. Bought it for 15300/- back then.

Picture quality is good, great brightness and colour calibration but the build quality is not. The edges of the glass panel are not smooth and seamless You will notice it as soon as you sit in front. The plastic protective bezel around the glass display is of really cheap quality and paint has started to chip. Pixel pitch is okay (about 116 I think) if you use this monitor from a 2 feet of distance. NOT recommended for MacOS, fonts look really bad.

Some people have told me this monitor costs a little extra for the special colour calibration from the factory which is nice but shouldn't that be a factory standard for all monitors anyways?

Power on-off + controls switch ( It's a joystick actually ) has a built-in white light which you can set to remain off or on. It serves as a keyboard light in dark rooms which I think is a brilliant idea!

Speakers are just bad, so bad that they don't even deserve a review.

2HDMI, 1 VGA, 1 Line-in, 1 Headphone. Ports are alright but in horizontal position so if you plugin 2 cables side-by-size there is barely any space between them.

Stand looks nice, cheap quality plastic again. Has a recycled kind of metal bar hidden underneath, attached for weight and stability. There is NO HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT and just a small amount of tilt. There is NO WOBBLE like everyone around here has been complaining, you guys need a sturdy table 😋

Monitor comes with a control utility which you need to download from LG's website. It's okay and allows you use monitor in different modes. But I think 23.8 inch isn't that big enough for effective use of those features.

Other brands with similar or even bigger size of monitors are much much cheaper with same or better performance.

Oh one major issue if you are hoping to use the VESA mount. The VESA screw ports are way up the monitor edge so if you mount it along side any other monitor this one will sit really low. I didn't realise is until after few months when I mounted it to a dual monitor setup with my existing Samsung display. Ugh! 🤦‍♂️"

332,4.4 out of 5,"Nice build quality and stand was sturdy too. Bezels were truly slim and immersive. There was no HDMI cable provided. There are 2 HDMI ports, an audio in and audio out plus a speaker (gives clear but low sound).

Unfortunately I had to return it. I needed this as my 2nd output for my laptop (Acer predator Helios 300) and the color vibrancy and blacks were no where similar to my laptop's. I tried all settings and combinations in monitor and through graphics settings but failed to achieve a similar looking display.

The blacks on these are like grey and there is no backlight bleeding but screen is giving out an even whitish light even on low brightness. Changing contrast doesn't do anything much due to which colors looks washed out sometimes but details on high resolution videos are better.

There are no pixalations, colors looks natural but again deep blacks are no where to be found. Texts appears best on this screen. Looking at this display and then my laptop's to and fro continuously was straining my eyes badly.

Now I got HP 22es and after smalls changes it easily looks like my laptop's display and a true extension with deeper blacks. So I suggest buying this monitor for standalone use (where you don't have to compare and just enjoy the high res natural colors this display has to offer) or if you have similar VA panel from before. I used BenQ TN panel monitor before and didn't face this problem before. Anyway there are no major drawbacks in the monitor itself. This is the best monitor in this price range considering the features it has. Going for HP 22es I had to miss out on dual HDMIs, audio in, audio out and speakers."

1.Was aware of the fact that it's a TN panel monitor. Viewing angles are poor , but when seeing the monitor straight on , it's nice to use.
2. It's having few modes like gaming mode , reading mode and manual RGB filtering. These are just some brightness changes as far as I've seen.
3. It's good for viewing content or office purpose. Does not satisfy it's gaming monito tag.

Linux users should keep in mind that even though we don't have drivers monitor still works pretty well. If you are using a laptop then by default the graphic setting is usually Hybrid. Make sure to change it to integrated or Nvidia. I am on POP_OS! so this option comes by default.

If you don't have it in your machine refer to Optimus switcher program (Just search on google)"

Exactly 15.5 inches at 1280x800 as mentioned.
Super bright and sharp panel.
Many controls for color, brightness, etc...
Both HDMI and VGA Ports works perfectly.
Good quality HDMI cable is included with it.
Good secure packaging.
Wall mount support

Cons:
You will need to buy large extendable wall mount for mounting because the power connecter sticks 1 inch more from the monitor..
19 inch widescreen TV in Picture but the product is 15.4"" 16:10 one.
There are holes for speakers but no speaker is present.

Earlier i was considering 24inch of the same model but the price difference was of 4k INR and i did not find it worth but still i had doubts in my mind that whether i made a mistake or what. But once i got this product and i set it up, I'm telling you guyz, it is just awesome and for programmers I don't think that 4k is worth. That 2 inch difference is not something that you could notice. Infact, after using this 22 inch monitor, i think 1080 is the best resolution, and going 24 or 27 is overkill and you could see the pixels in the screen. So, if you are buying a FHD monitor, 22 inch is the best size you should go for, 24 and 27 inch is best for 1440 resolution.

Ideally we expect a height adjustment as well but tilt adjustment is such a basic feature to have to set a monitor ergonomically and work tirelessly.

but unforturnately, this monitor is not even perfectly straight. it is tilted towards front/user. this makes viewing and working very diffuclt.

apart from that there is blur in side edges which isnt upto an LG standards for monitors.

buy a better product. and please know that amazon doesnt gives easy returns nowadays. they have some policies to issue refund only when they dont have a replacement available. they have told me to provide a return on some conditions, but am not pleased with their return policy, because when you make a buy they clearly write return or replacement available till 19 november, but will offer only replacement when you buy products..

product fits perfectly for 22 inch monitor. Few models May have a problem where the cable connectors are at the back side positioned horizontally instead of pointing down. That may stretch the cover a bit but still should fit in.

419,4.5 out of 5,"Product description: ***** Received as described
Installation: **** Medium Efforts(easy)
Build quality : ***** Very Good

Value for money : *****(bought it for 6960 ₹)

Box contains:
✔️ 2 gas spring arms
✔️ Vesa mount pattern 75mm & 100mm
✔️ 1 base clamp
✔️ 1 base pillar
✔️ lots of screws and 2 Allen keys

The good:
➕ Easy gas spring adjustment
➕ Integrated cable management
➕ Dual installation options C clamp/grommet mount
➕ Dual motion full monitor
➕ Vesa pattern options 75mm/100mm

The bad:
➖ little bit costly (but have gas springs)

Assembly was fairly straight forward. I had it installed within 15 minutes.

First, take it out of the box, the arms are tied down with a tie wrap. As soon as you cut it, the arms will extend, so make sure that you hold the arm and the base is against something. There is a caution sticker attached with instructions.

The arms are sturdy and stay in place when I move the monitors. Their range of motion is also really impressive, allowing me to perfectly line up the two screens despite them being different brands. Also, the all-black construction looks so much better than a lot of other models.

The base itself was a lot bigger then I expected and did look a lot sturdier as it covered a wider surface area.

I used the clamp that however clamp was not able to accommodate the thickness of my desk so compensated with the chunks of boards.

I have 2x 25"" curve screens and 2x old 16"" flat screens. Vesa installation can be used but my monitors were not VESA compatible so I ordered non-VESA mount adapters to accommodate 16"" AOC old monitors. It worked like charm. Max screen size that arms could accommodate is 29"" weighing 8 kg each.

Rotation:
 • Arm joint attached to pillar = 135°
 • Mid arm joint = 180°
 • Vesa joint with arm = 90°
 • Vesa and monitor = 180°

Very impressed by the range of motion that I was able to get out of it and was easy to move with the gas springs.

Even gas spring tension can be adjusted according to your requirements.

Very solid, versatile, easy to assemble with clear directions, air-pistons fully functional and adjustable.

I was impressed with how much space I saved and how neat the whole thing looked!

All in all, I am totally happy with the item, the price, and the vendor. I would highly recommend it."

421,4.1 out of 5,"Product description: ***** Received as described
Installation: **** Medium Efforts(easy)
Build quality : ***** Very Good

Value for money : *****(bought it for 6960 ₹)

Box contains:
✔️ 2 gas spring arms
✔️ Vesa mount pattern 75mm & 100mm
✔️ 1 base clamp
✔️ 1 base pillar
✔️ lots of screws and 2 Allen keys

The good:
➕ Easy gas spring adjustment
➕ Integrated cable management
➕ Dual installation options C clamp/grommet mount
➕ Dual motion full monitor
➕ Vesa pattern options 75mm/100mm

The bad:
➖ little bit costly (but have gas springs)

Assembly was fairly straight forward. I had it installed within 15 minutes.

First, take it out of the box, the arms are tied down with a tie wrap. As soon as you cut it, the arms will extend, so make sure that you hold the arm and the base is against something. There is a caution sticker attached with instructions.

The arms are sturdy and stay in place when I move the monitors. Their range of motion is also really impressive, allowing me to perfectly line up the two screens despite them being different brands. Also, the all-black construction looks so much better than a lot of other models.

The base itself was a lot bigger then I expected and did look a lot sturdier as it covered a wider surface area.

I used the clamp that however clamp was not able to accommodate the thickness of my desk so compensated with the chunks of boards.

I have 2x 25"" curve screens and 2x old 16"" flat screens. Vesa installation can be used but my monitors were not VESA compatible so I ordered non-VESA mount adapters to accommodate 16"" AOC old monitors. It worked like charm. Max screen size that arms could accommodate is 29"" weighing 8 kg each.

Rotation:
 • Arm joint attached to pillar = 135°
 • Mid arm joint = 180°
 • Vesa joint with arm = 90°
 • Vesa and monitor = 180°

Very impressed by the range of motion that I was able to get out of it and was easy to move with the gas springs.

Even gas spring tension can be adjusted according to your requirements.

Very solid, versatile, easy to assemble with clear directions, air-pistons fully functional and adjustable.

I was impressed with how much space I saved and how neat the whole thing looked!

423,4.1 out of 5,"I was having a monitor for my desktop for past 8 years which was from Samsung and was of 1600*900 resolution.
During this time, I upgraded my CPU twice, but not the monitor. But recently my GTX1070Ti started creating problem with the low resolution of the old monitor. This created the need to buy a new desktop monitor.
After a tremendous & thorough research, I narrowed down to this monitor. I wanted quality, reliability and at the same time didn't want to spend unnecessarily for the features I may not be using frequently. My need was for gaming, browsing, and for my hobby (3d designing for 3d printing & software coding).
After two weeks of research, I found this Samsung LED monitor to suit my needs.
After using this monitor for more than a month, here are my experiences;
1. Beautiful design and looks. Looks premium with very thin bezels on three sides.
2. Display quality is awesome.
3. Structurally rigid (not like LG, which is wobbly)

Overall this product is awesome. If you are looking for a desktop monitor in the price range of Rs.10000 to Rs.12000, this will be the ideal one. Again it depends on your needs and what you are looking for in a desktop PC monitor."

447,4.3 out of 5,"Well I Have had it for Day now, Here are my initial impressions
I have been using it as a Second Display with Mac Mini for a dual-screen setup

Good
---------
:-Good punchy colours, pictures look vibrant and curve enhances visual experience
:-simple ton connections there only one HDMI1.2 and 1 Display Port nothing much to talk about
:- Good for Media Consumption or viewing
:-I think fancy TV Styled as a Monitor rather than a Monitor that can be used as a TV, ideal for gaming or
Media only

Bad
-------
:- Not Good for text related work
:- if you are reading documents and doing text-related work, You have to be sitting at 1 arm's length or a
tad bit more distance for texts to look decent
:- Not ideal for office or work-related stuff as it needs Sharp texts and contrast
:- Monitor inbuilt functions for contrast, brightness do not make much diff I think there's is not much you
have in your hands to calibrate boosting or enhancing contrast to your liking or what suits your Display
needs
:- I Definitely now notice screen bleed when Dark scenes are there on all four corners so...yes bleed is imminent it seems"

451,4.4 out of 5,After 2 weeks of Delay due to some shipping issues because of some external errors I received the package with some dents and scratches probably used one or returned item(You can see the pics for proof). I’ve asked 3 times to seller(could be manufacturer himself) about the laptops weight capacity all 3 times received a positive response saying that it’d hold my laptop as such. But after things are being assembled(thanks for detailed and clear instructions) I found out that laptop stand goes down to the table though things are fitted properly. Here comes the monitor arm issue. As the mount bracket and it’s holder doesn’t have proper gripping monitor is facing downwards a bit. Am not sure whether to expect a perfection for this price or the product should justify the price.

It said in the installation manual that the max weight per monitor should not be more than 7 kg, I was apprehensive if my 27"" monitor is heavier than that, but on measuring it was only 5 kg after removing the desk mount stand.

The 24"" Samsung monitor I was able to mount with the included screws and washers, but the 27"" Crossover 27QW needed raisers as the screws were bit long. Luckily I had couple of raisers which came with another TV mount.

Overall, a well made decently priced dual monitor mount."

The 24"" Samsung monitor I was able to mount with the included screws and washers, but the 27"" Crossover 27QW needed raisers as the screws were bit long. Luckily I had couple of raisers which came with another TV mount.

Overall, a well made decently priced dual monitor mount."

Picture is sharp and crisp. While it does support HDCP, it lacks HDCP 2.2. 10 bit color is possible only in 60 Hz. It defaults to 8 bit in 75 Hz, which is a minor con. It is more than enough for 1440p gaming at 60 Hz or 75 Hz. Casual gamers need not worry. It's good enough. The stand is perfectly functional. The placement of the cable mounts and the buttons are absolutely awful. If you can look past that, just go for it."

Normally Amazon allows only 1 replacement, so I had to return the order after finding that 2 times I had dead pixels in the monitor.

Then I proceeded with another order, hoping that this time situations would improve.
Unfortunately, the 3rd monitor (in the 2nd order) also had defective pixels, which made me upset and I chose a reeplacement.

Sadly, the 4th monitor sold by these fellows have 4 dead pixels in it. I would have to live with it now.

1. Height adjustable - so that I don’t have to adjust (lower) my chair height and hurt my legs and knees. Monitor comes up to my eye level easily.
2. Higher refresh rate so that display is smooth. I mean when I’m spending, might as well get a higher refresh rate.
3. Curved screen so that my 9 hours a day PC work is easy on my eye. I use a lot of excel. My eyes started burning on prolonged laptop screen usage of excel or any other small font application.
4. Dell as a brand. All my PC, laptop and peripherals are Dell. This has 3 years warranty (I verified by adding this monitor to my account after ownership transfer).
5. I use it with my gaming laptop as well for GTA. Feels extremely dope. Great colours and brightness. I did a side by side comparison of same YouTube video with my work laptop, personal laptop, LED TV and this monitor. This monitor fared best.

This monitor has a huge issue, that's BGR sub pixel layout, which makes text so blurry which hurt your eyes. Windows cleartext helps but there are many program which does not support cleartext as a result text appears blurry, especially in grey background, which is also know as dark mode.

My friend and I bought this monitor and we both experienced dead pixels and weird yellow light bleeding from both bottom ends, we replaced them and observed similar yellow light in replacement models too. People on reddit are also talking about this issue. You can refer to the images. Gigabyte's Quality control seems to be very bad or they are knowingly shipping these faulty units in India. All of the units were manufactured in Nov 2020. Why are they selling 8+ months old products? Something does not seems right here .

As like most of the users I want monitor not only for gaming but for normal browsing, office work (9 hours a day), watching web/TV series and movies. So I can't compromise on such basic things after paying 33k. I refunded the monitor at the end and went for MSI Optix MAG274QRF."

Con: whites aren't as perfect.(but most monitors under 15k and maybe 20k are like this)
Also recommendation to everyone reading: it's not worth buying a 24inch monitor that's 1080p. Go for a 22inch 1080p. It's the same reason 6inch phones need 1080p. The pixel density makes a real big difference. Also,
Va displays have the best contrast ratios and much better response times than ips. After doing lot of research you will find that modern VAs are the best choice. And this Philips one is truly worth it.
Philips seems like the best deal here."

Also recommendation to everyone reading: it's not worth buying a 24inch monitor that's 1080p. Go for a 22inch 1080p. It's the same reason 6inch phones need 1080p. The pixel density makes a real big difference. Also,
Va displays have the best contrast ratios and much better response times than ips. After doing lot of research you will find that modern VAs are the best choice. And this Philips one is truly worth it.
Philips seems like the best deal here."

539,5 out of 5,"First of all, don’t mind the reviews about screen bleed issues reported, either they have got a defect batch or expecting too much from a 24inch monitor worth 8K. Has it got screen bleed? Only if you are looking for it, that too in completely black screen, nothing disturbing of that sort. If you’re looking for exceptional viewing experience spend more and buy an advanced monitor. With this monitor you get what you pay for and some.

When I was booking the monitor there was deal of the day happening and the price was 8100 and when I ordered I got an instant bank discount of 800rs, so I got the monitor for 7300, which is a killer deal for this monitor.

Coming to the package, it was really well packed, monitor was completely protected by thermocol and packed inside one. Very good packing. Mounting the monitor was just plug and play matter. No height adjustment. You get HDMI and VGA cable with it, I connected through HDMI cable, that should give a better viewing experience if you have got a good GPU. Power adaptor is also of good quality.

I was using AOC 19inch monitor before and this sure is a big monitor and will get some getting used to. HD videos are splendid and games play rather well on this screen, this is not a gaming monitor, but for what you paid, you won’t be complaining.

I did a monitor screen test online and this monitor passed the test with flying colours.

Extremely happy with my purchase and I will update if any issue crops up."

551,4.7 out of 5,"Ok, I was little skeptical about buying this monitor from Amazon as there were very limited reviews and the product was new but I believed in Samsung and ordered it. Boy this monitor is gorgeous.
Pros,
1) Punchy colors, good color accuracy, deep blacks (don't expect amoled level).
2) Three side bezel less design.
3) No dead pixels on the screen.
4) 75hz out of the box.
5) Made by Samsung that means no need to worry about servicing.
6) Supports vesa mount.
7) Comes with eye care feature (which is basically blue light cutter) out of the box.
Cons,
1) No builtin speakers and No audio jack for audio out.
2) Little too bright for my liking (I always keep the brightness below 25).

This monitor supports AMD freesync and refresh rates upto 75Hz, I don't have AMD GPU on my laptop to test freesync but surprisingly, I was able to set the refresh rate to 75Hz without Freesync (Please find the attached image). I was bit worried about dead pixels issue which is very common with most of the budget IPS panels but again I was pleasantly surprised to see no dead pixels on the screen (verified on Deadpixelbuddy)

Also I was able to authenticate the product and register it online with Samsung India to claim 36 months warranty. Happy with the seller for selling Samsung genuine products.

I couldn't test the gaming performance as I don't run games on my laptop, will try to update this review once I'm able to enjoy gaming session on this screen.

The one thing that is not documented anywhere is that it that quadHD / 2k displays don't play well with macOS. You need at least a 4k display ( 5k if you can afford it to match the retina standards your eyes get used to while working on a macbook pro ). The text/font on macOS looks super blurry and hard to read. I tried everything under the sun to fix it but to no avail. I have sore eyes with just a week of usage.

563,4.4 out of 5,"I got it for around 11.5K. At this price point it feels like a great competitor to Benq IPS monitor.

PROS:
-------------------

-Sturdy AF monitor stand:
This ensures that the monitor is sturdy and minimizes the wobble. It has a better stand most of the other brands at this price point as they all offer plastic stand, the wobble from which would definitely be noticeably more. I don't think I would ever be going back to using a monitor with a plastic stand after using this one.

-Good Picture quality:
Out of the box the blue shade was a little bit more than it usually should be, but after calibration this was comparable to panels from LG or Benq. For comparison I am using a LG 27MP59G along side this and the picture quality from Zebronics panel is almost the same.
I didn't face any issues while playing games on this but still I would not recommend this monitor if you want to play a competitive fighting game like street fighter or tekken on this.

-Thin Bezels:
The bezels are actully really thin. While the physical bezels seem to be paper thin, the actual LED and the outsides of the monitor make the bezel about 0.8cm which is great.

-Budget friendly:
There are not many monitors that offer thin bezel, great picture quality and viewing angles along with the 27inch screen size at this price point. Zebronics has definitely done a great job here.

-Indian Company:
Although this may sound really stupid but this was one of the reasons why I actually bought this monitor as I wanted to try something new, specially from an Indian brand and I am actually impressed. Hence this long review.

-Included Aux cable:
This may not be useful for everyone, but it was good to see someone include a aux cable out of the box since this monitor has a audio out port at the back.

-Vesa Mount:
Can't praise Zebronics any more at this point.

CONS:
----------------

-Only available in white color:
I feel this is mostly depends on personal preference. I personally prefer black monitors as watching media on them feels more immersive.

-Buttons on the side:
The adjustment buttons are available on the right-hand side of the monitor. If you are using a multi-monitor setup then you have to make sure that there is no other monitor on the right hand side of this monitor since that would hinder your ability to do any adjustments using the side panel buttons. This somewhat beats the purpose of a slim bezel monitor.

-Only VGA included:
Most of the modern devices have HDMI as the standard video output port. Zebronics could have included a HDMI cable instead of a VGA since HDMI is a better standard to use than a VGA. (they don't differ alot in terms of pricing).
I fell this leads to decreasing the price difference between this monitor and some other monitors as they already have HDMI included out of the box (Benq) and you would have to buy a seperate HDMI cable with this one.

-No monitor adjustment:
I don't think there is any way to actually adjust the monitor but the more than sturdy monitor stand kind of makes up for this con.

works great makes life easy and working with large spread sheets is a breeze. The monitor also doubles up as my TV, sound is poor so I purchased a sound bar that is no issue. But LG have gone monumentally greedy and jacked up the price by 10k. This is not acceptable don't buy unless the price goes down."

575,4.3 out of 5,"This monitor was delivered to me on Sep 12 2019. I was very excited about this monitor it came with near bezel less design and is a 1080p resolution. I was shocked by how it turned out. The IPS bleed is horrible. It is visible on all corners. Even if you decide to ignore them, there is even more crazier issues. There is no fluedity in videos, even if you are watching 1080p video at 60fps, there is visibke stuttering. Cant even watch hdr content online. Terrible for gaming as well due to stuttering."

583,4.5 out of 5,"I'm the first buyer of this product.
The one that I received was defective. It had a pale red patch in the top center of the screen. Image attached. Currently returning this one for a replacement. Will update as the replacement arrives.

Things you should know before buying this product:
1. It is a Gsync compatible only monitor, not a Gsync ultimate one. This means there is no Gsync module inside. It is just an Nvidia version of Freesync.
2. The one I received had little to no backlight bleeding, but there was huge amount of IPS glow and it was awful. Rtings.com also says that this monitor has such high amounts of IPS glow. The backlight bleeding varies from unit to unit.
3. Poor viewing angles - The viewing angles on this monitor is like that of a TN panel. This is because of the strong IPS glow. Rtings.com also found the same.
4. Vignetting effect - The horrendous amount of IPS glow creates a vignetting effect. Pixels farther away from the screen appears dim.
5. Non-uniform brightness - The brightness is not uniform everywhere on the screen. This is also related to the vignetting effect.
6. There were two dead pixels that I could find. Being a 4k display, they were far too small to cause any nuisance.

There were no issues of flickering, or vertical banding or sleep-to-wake problem, or dust particles being stuck beneath the screen.

Some good things about the monitor:
1. The colors are terrific. I haven't seen such beautiful reds. They are like blood.
2. If you are a programmer, then dark modes look beautiful on this one (and in general on all IPS monitors). Dark mode is typically bad on VA monitors because of the high contrast ratio of VA panels that makes the text look like floating on ink. On IPS panels, dark backgrounds look like they are moonlight, if you understand what I mean. On VA panels, the background is like deep ink. IMO, the moonlight is more easy on the eyes.

Overall this is the cheapest 4k144Hz monitor. I don't think you will find anything better than this up until the X27. If it were not for the red patch in the center of the screen, I would have kept it.

Also, I couldn't comment on the fluidity of the panel, since my GPU does not support 144Hz output. I have purchased a new GPU which will take a few days to arrive. I'll update this review after that. Also, I'll update on my findings with the replacement unit.

Update:--
~~~~~~~~
This is incredibly shameful. I wrote 10+ emails, called Amazon customer care 10+ times, and even today I spoke with a senior customer care executive who escalated the matter. But still the return pickup guy did not come to pick up the aforementioned items.
Currently, I am waiting on my 11th day since I started the return process."

587,4 out of 5,"I was looking for a high quality monitor for WFH setup with height adjustment and swivel. The height and tilt adjustment is very useful for long working hours where you keep changing sitting position, attend long calls. It is very relaxing to attend call while standing near desk. Also there is enough space if you up uplift the monitor to max height and keep laptop below it. The 2 screen will be like stack on each other. Earlier I was looking for model - P2219H, but it was out of stock. Then found P2222H is better in look, boarder less design and 2021 year model. So I ordered it and highly satisfied for working needs. By the way Dell is my all time favorite brand from college days. The 24 inch model is little bigger but my preference was 22 inch model. I mostly switch work with 14 inch laptop. So choosing for 22 inch monitor instead 24 is best as it brings down screen gap. One thing, there is no speaker in the monitor and it comes with 13 Amp plug. You may need to buy a 6 amp plug. There is HDMI VGA and Display port with USB hub.

The 22 inch monitor have another advantage as it consume less power than 24 inch, I manged to run it almost 2 hour on my APC BACK UPS 600.

It has 3 years onsite warranty."

Better to go with HD monitors which has LED display and are of half of the price.

598,4.3 out of 5,"Although i did plenty research on every aspect before purchase, but eventually have mixed feelings.
Pros :
-- Very beautiful sleek design! (As good as Predator series, a major reason why i chose this! And it takes very less space compared to those old roundish bottom flat monitors ehe... its looks are a killer! :) )
-- Anti Reflective Matt Coating is effective.
-- IPS Panel, so wonderful wide viewing angle. Truly 178 degree horizontal and vertical, many people can see.
-- Important Connections : Display Port 1.2, HDMI 1.4 , Audio Out Jax (good thing they didnt waste money on waste speakers like rest), so you can make it a TV with added speakers using HDMI and Audio Jack.
-- Actual response time is 5ms, which is decent for an IPS panel.
-- FREE SYNC! Trust me, MUCH better than Vsync of even best GTX1080ti! (only Gsync could match it), Say good bye to screen tearing. And hopefully AMD FREE SYNC will get NVIDIA off their high horses huh... I aint AMD fanboy, but we really wish fair competition instead of Evil Monopoly!
-- And hey, brightness was surprising all right! i thought this 250 nits will be much lesser than 300 Nits i was used to on laptop and old LG19inch but 250 nits is well spread, screen bleeding is minimal)
-- A lot of Controls! Yeup, i like being able to totally customize every aspect, and this monitor gives you A Lot of options! (even 2 3 4 screens on same! Although the control button is like Old Nokia mobile 4 way stick, but so far so good...)
-- And it does work at 75hz! (unlike what other ppl claim thats only FreeSync feature for AMD), i used on GTX1050ti OC.
-- Balanced pricing for features it offers.
Cons:
-- ALAS! The Color Accuracy, contrast is NOT As good as i imagined... duh, my biggest and only disappointment i guess, my old LG19 Inch Flatron has better color! huh, i wasnt hoping this from IPS panel which boasts 72% on Adobe, and same on Color Gamut... Its not bad but just not great, so lets hope, i can get some color calibration so that it becomes as good as it boasts!
-- Lack of Tilting or Twisting
-- No VESA support or Height Adjustment (atleast VESA MUST be there, then you can mount on stand and adjust), i took this as known compromise, still if you have worked on height adjustment, you will miss it.
-- AND REMEMBER! If you go to 1080p from 720 or even 900p, then you MUST have stronger CPU and GPU! Or else, screen Tearing etc will be unbearable!
-- And 1ms Motion Blurr is arrant nonsense! Trust me, you are much better without it!
And other things like Power Consumption etc are normal for IPS Monitors at this price range.
And btw, i got from Appario, the product was nicely double packed! (yep, double pack). With warranty card and bill. Clean new piece.
So i wrote what i could remember, a bag of mixed feelings.. but overall, 4/5, and i am staying with it.."

-- Important Connections : Display Port 1.2, HDMI 1.4 , Audio Out Jax (good thing they didnt waste money on waste speakers like rest), so you can make it a TV with added speakers using HDMI and Audio Jack.
-- Actual response time is 5ms, which is decent for an IPS panel.
-- FREE SYNC! Trust me, MUCH better than Vsync of even best GTX1080ti! (only Gsync could match it), Say good bye to screen tearing. And hopefully AMD FREE SYNC will get NVIDIA off their high horses huh... I aint AMD fanboy, but we really wish fair competition instead of Evil Monopoly!
-- And hey, brightness was surprising all right! i thought this 250 nits will be much lesser than 300 Nits i was used to on laptop and old LG19inch but 250 nits is well spread, screen bleeding is minimal)
-- A lot of Controls! Yeup, i like being able to totally customize every aspect, and this monitor gives you A Lot of options! (even 2 3 4 screens on same! Although the control button is like Old Nokia mobile 4 way stick, but so far so good...)
-- And it does work at 75hz! (unlike what other ppl claim thats only FreeSync feature for AMD), i used on GTX1050ti OC.
-- Balanced pricing for features it offers.
Cons:
-- ALAS! The Color Accuracy, contrast is NOT As good as i imagined... duh, my biggest and only disappointment i guess, my old LG19 Inch Flatron has better color! huh, i wasnt hoping this from IPS panel which boasts 72% on Adobe, and same on Color Gamut... Its not bad but just not great, so lets hope, i can get some color calibration so that it becomes as good as it boasts!
-- Lack of Tilting or Twisting
-- No VESA support or Height Adjustment (atleast VESA MUST be there, then you can mount on stand and adjust), i took this as known compromise, still if you have worked on height adjustment, you will miss it.
-- AND REMEMBER! If you go to 1080p from 720 or even 900p, then you MUST have stronger CPU and GPU! Or else, screen Tearing etc will be unbearable!
-- And 1ms Motion Blurr is arrant nonsense! Trust me, you are much better without it!
And other things like Power Consumption etc are normal for IPS Monitors at this price range.
And btw, i got from Appario, the product was nicely double packed! (yep, double pack). With warranty card and bill. Clean new piece.
So i wrote what i could remember, a bag of mixed feelings.. but overall, 4/5, and i am staying with it.."

606,4.3 out of 5,"I would give it a 5 star but I am sure it's already been used before. The paint is chipped at couple of places and it has scratches on the paint. The packaging was also old and in pretty bad shape.

I have one suggestion about installation. If your desk is like mine and the only way to install is by using grommet. Make sure you use a drill bit which is atleast 10 or 11 mm in size to make a hole. The screw for grommet installation is atleast 10 inch in thickness. Which took me by surprise. But if your desk has the option to use clamp for installation it is pretty straight forward. Just use the guide and you will be done in about 20 minutes.

It took me whole evening because I didn't have the appropriate drill bits. The stand is quite heavy duty and sturdy. It can easily hold monitors and TV's upto 35 inch display. Looks good after installation. Best for those who want to reduce clutter on their desk and keep a minimalstic look."

You can't ask for more at a price of 33-34k.

The display is gorgeous, and thanks to the incredible contrast ratio of 3000:1, you can even use it as a smart TV with a Firestick 4K or Mi Box 4k (I got this).

I'm a designer so I got it because of the color accuracy and it delivers perfectly. I can barely distinguish the colours from my 16"" MacBook Pro display.

Keep in mind, it's a VA panel and not IPS panel so you might feel the colours are not as punchy but again, the contrast ratio (3000:1) is a lot superior (IPS panels usually have 1000:1) as a result which means your blacks look closer to black than the dark greys you instead see on IPS panels."

622,3.8 out of 5,"Just got the monitor an hour back. The monitor itself is so light and thin, I thought it's just a cardboard and missed it in the first glance. Digged deep in the package to find my monitor!
But then I realized the one I thought as card board is the monitor. My god it is so light. Believe me, I am not exaggerating.
Once I unpacked the monitor in 2 minutes I was able to connect to the laptop and had my second monitor working.
The pixel quality is good and text is also sharp. Brightness is also well adequate if you are working indoors.
Color reproduction is also very good.
I was looking for Asus or Lenovo portable monitors since they are much cheaper than this monitor. However, those monitors work only with USB C ports. But this one can work with HDMI and USB both, that's the main advantage. My laptop anyway supports HMDI and it was a easy plug and play with out needing any additional hardware or driver.

One thing that the seller or even the Cloudwalker website doesn't mention is the contents of the package.
The package comes with
- Standard USB C,
- HDMI to HDMI mini
- USB 2.0 to USB C cable as weill

I am happy with my purchase. I can store my monitor and laptop safely in the wardrobe after my work everyday.
My desk looks clean after work.

The cover is sturdy and nice. Overall build quality is excellent. If you have money go for it."

The monitor I received had no issues of dead pixel, the height adjustment is awesome. I got the monitor for approx 15k with festival and other discounts. It has a little warm colors compared to my LG 24"" which is on the right side in the images, but it is bearable.

Few people have received damaged monitors and that is definitely the mistake of seller or improper handling by delivery person.

I would recommend this monitor to others but yes, do proper checkup when you receive it as many are getting defective product. The monitor itself is awesome.

656,3.6 out of 5,"Edit : After about 3-4 months of use, 1-2 full vertical column of LED's has gone bad near the right side of the screen. Initially it was just1 vertical column, then two LED columns went bad. Can be seen in the latest/last pic that I have put . This monitor has got quality issues. I did not expect this kinda quality issues from a reputed brand like Lenovo. Totally unhappy. I'm now searching for the warranty claim procedure. Do not recommend this monitor due to quality issues.

Edit : I've been trying to get in touch with the lenovo support guys to claim this warranty, but in vain. They have support only for corporate products, but nothing for normal consumer products. Its easier to contact the presidents office than be able to get in touch with lenovo customer support. MOst of the support numbers listed are obsolete . Even after you get in touch with their customer support, there is no means of tracking the status or progress of your issue/ticket. Feeling helpless and frustrated.

Edit : After multiple frustrating calls, emails and regular follow up with the Lenovo support centre for about 20+ days, I finally received a replacement monitor . Will have to see if this one shows any defects in the next few months. Keeping my fingers crossed.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MONITOR DUE TO SERIOUS QUALITY ISSUES.

I bought the Lenovo Q27-q10 after a lot of research. I wanted to upgrade to a 27” monitor and I was in a dilemma if I should go for a 1080p or 1440p monitor. Going for this QHD ( 2560x1440 ) monitor was a great choice. This resolution offers great screen space, with a lot more content visible at once.
Coming to the monitor, below are my observations:
Pro’s :
1. The monitor is very thin and lightweight, but study enough. Stand is also robust and does not shake like some other models. The stand is a bit deep, so gives you space to tuck in your keyboard when not in use.
2. Colours are crisp and deep and vivid ( though its only 8 bit colour ). 2k videos look very good and vivid when viewed on this monitor. Haven’t played any games ( I’m not a gamer) so cannot comment on the response time and refresh rate.
3. The volume on the speakers, though not loud, is decent and can be used to watch some entertainment without the need for additional/external speakers.
4. Antiglare coating is good and very useful. Can watch movies comfortable even when there are lights behind you due to this antiglare coating.

Cons :
1. The height of the monitor is not adjustable. Only tilt can be adjusted. The height at which the lower bezel starts is a bit high, making the top of the monitor go a bit above your eye level. Having the top of the monitor exactly at your eye level is recommended for good ergonomics.
2. Though the bezel is thin, the screen image does not extend to the very edges of the bezel as is deceptively shown in the video or the pics in the site. There is actually some gap between the end of the screen and the bezel, as can be seen in one of my pic.
3. For some strange reason, volume control of the monitor is not possible from your Macbook. You get the controls on the laptop when you connect a Windows machine, but not in the Mac. So Mac users will have to adjust with constant volume or control the volume via the buttons.
4. The cable management system that is provides is utterly useless.

Overall it’s a good buy if you are looking for a budget QHD monitor. Satisfied with the monitor."

* Sturdy. Feels sturdy. Doesnt look like one of those LG/lenovo sleek models which might break anytime
* This is the new model/replacement to P2419H model, so if u are reluctant wether to purchase this compared to P2419H, you can blindly go for this. As this is just the same monitor but more recent model. They both are the same, this product has less reviews coz this monitor is released on 2021 and P2419H is 2018 released hence higher number of reviews.
* ZERO backlight bleeding. DELL has done a pretty good job at this
* Height is adjustable. Screen is 90 degree rotatable

* U dont get no HDMI cable - U will need to get that urself"

The bezels are super thin but there is still a black border. Expect 3/8"" from edge to actual display. The high refresh rate is nice while gaming but being honest, there is not going to be very much difference in 1080p monitors these days. Mine both look good with no pixel anomalies on either of the two.

Where this unit shines is it's stand! It adjusts it just about every way possible. It has the normal tilt but can also both rotate to adjusting or turning it landscape, as well as swivel on it's base. And best of all, it has a tension system to easily adjust the height. This is so amazingly useful when adjusting multi-monitor setups. When I eventually upgrade from 1080p, I plan to use these stands on anything I get. If they are not compatible, I will make them compatible. lol

I wish more manufacturers would put more into their stands like this."

672,3.7 out of 5,"This model is ‘ok’ at best. Nothing spectacular about this product. Picture quality seems good, but extremely thick bezels like a 2010 model. Looks are extremely bad, I got bored even in first day. Brightness is meh, just not good enough. Nothing specially good in this monitor.
The HDMI cable can’t support 4K@60fps. You need display port for that.
Few other points to consider:
- Works with MacBook pro , you get full 4K resolution. But like I mentioned only 30fps through HDMI.
- The monitor shakes quite a bit, the stand is not very sturdy. A light movement shakes the monitor. May want to invest on VESA mount if you want.
- The cable length is decent, Easily more than 2m.
- The monitor control is via a small 'joy stick', it's made of plastic and flimsy.
- The control interface/software of monitor is old-school style. The design of software is not that appealing.
- Didn't face any flickering so far."

684,4.3 out of 5,"PROS:
- All required tools are provided
- Feels sturdy
- Somewhat ok instructional manual, though seller/company should upload some assembly video to youtube.

CONS:
-The product is extreemely diificult to assemble.
-To fit the screws in the groove it requires lot of effort.
-Does not feel like gas spring operated. I have used gas spring arms in my office earlier and they are very smooth in operating.
- However this one has arms which are extreemely tight and requires to use the alex screws to loosen and adjust.
-Even after assembling the arm, moving it requires lot of effort to move it around.

OVERALL - It is better to search for other products which cost a bit more but which are truely gas spring operated and have smooth mechanism. Do not believe on all the positive reviews. If you want your monitor to be stationary then definitely buy it otherwise if you require some sort of movement or tilting avoid this product."

Also this supports daisy chaning and you can easily connect one more monitor to this(not duplicate display, you can use as extended monitor).

The product took waay too long to come, 10 days to be exact, 5 days past the expected delivery time.

Build quality - Average. There are visible holes through the wood, where the nails were hammered in. They didn't even try to make it look presentable, that's what you get when you spend only 999 I guess. Otherwise, it holds up. I'd be surprised if it didn't though, being so small.
I wouldn't bother using this as a monitor stand anyway, because it doesn't make much of a difference in height. Save up and buy a vesa mount monitor arm.

764,2 out of 5,"This review is for the 28 inch 4k CB282K. Been using it for 2 days so far and its a reeeeallly good display. Blacks are as deep as you can expect from an IPS display - very minimal backlight bleed (unnoticeable 99% of the time) and excellent colour accuracy all around. It came supplied with a colour calibration data from the factory with delta E less than 2 but they failed to mention what mode (sRGB? USER? Standard?) mode they calibrate under. Even without custom calibration with a Spyder or a Colormunki the colours are to the T when compared with my other calibrated monitor. sRGB does look a bit off though - slightly washed out and oversaturated. HDR isn't great but one can only expect so much from a 300 nit peak brightness and edge lit display. Still does add a solid punch to HDR games / videos though when activated in Windows. The speakers - just mute them off and do yourself a favour.

Overall a solid buy if you don't mind the lack of usb ports. Would highly recommend - especially at a steal price of 27000₹

Update : Calibrating the monitor with a Spyder Elite gives me a delta E of around 1.4 with an excellent 2.2 gamma. Colours are mostly on point but for red, black and green which shift off more than delta E of 2 but still lesser than 3

Update : It's been over a year now and the monitor works just as good as it did when I bought it"

807,4.4 out of 5,"I bought this monitor for two important reasons. First one being the contrast ratio and secondly the price.
I am more into deep blacks which only an OLED can deliver. So the other only alternative is a VA panel. This model from lenovo can deliver a 3000:1 contrast ratio that no other monitor can do at this price. My primary usage is for work and watch movies.
Quick tip: Set the monitor to 75Hz for better blacks and sharpness. The monitor is by default set to 60Hz.

Pros -
Slim bezels on three sides,
Excellent contrast ratio (3000 native) and hence deep blacks
Nice color reproduction,
Gentle on eyes.
Refresh rate up to 75Hz from the standard 60Hz

Cons -
The stand is very wobbly, so slight movement on the table will shake the monitor.
Colors are not so vibrant as our mobile screens/IPS displays
There is only one HDMI port for connection. So it is a hassle to switch between my personal and work systems."

Here i will tell you everything about KG241QS which has 165hz refresh rate and 0.5ms response time. the similar KG241QP has 144hz refresh rate and 1ms response time.

I have owned IPS panel monitor from LG ( 22mp68vq ) and before this monitor i owned Asus (VG258QE) that was a TN panel Monitor. I recently bought this monitor to actually check whats the difference in 25000rs tn panel and 12000rs tn panel. and when i received this monitor i compared it with side to side with Asus monitor and the difference between two was literally 0%. And comparing this with ips monitor i.e is LG there was a very unnoticable color difference which you will never even notice except white looking a very little yellowish type. And by very little i really mean very little.

I am just writing such big review for you guys to just tell you dont waste your money on pricier TN panels you wont notice even a bit of difference. I am loving this monitor gaming is heaven in this monitor so if you are planning to upgrade your monitor buy this use this n i can assure you that i will not be disappointed if you have used IPS panel before. if you want to invest your money invest it in either getting a 2k or get yourself a beast graphic card.

for approx 7500 - this is steal Dell P1917s - has similar specs but costs more
1280x1024 resolution on 19 inch screen is HD quality - has antiglare coating
will share more after using for some time
it comes with VGA and DVI connectors - no HDMI - but no big deal for a computer monitor"

819,4.5 out of 5,"This is the lowest priced 4K monitor which is good enough to consider buying. You might say that there are other 4K monitors in the 25k price range, but all those 28inch 4k panels are 4-year-old panels, and that too TN panels, that is the reason for their lower price. Those were one of the first 4k panels in the world, and their color quality was terrible. The only good thing about them was that they were 4k, but what is the point of it if a full HD 22-inch monitor beat it in terms of picture quality.

This Acer monitor has a 4k VA panel. Some of you might think VA is not good, but that is not at all true. VA has the best contrast ratio which is around 3000:1 while IPS and TN have it less than 1000:1. This matters a lot in terms of picture quality. Pictures in VA will look richer while IPS will look washed out if you compare them side to side. VA is excellent for viewing photos, watching movies, general computer tasks etc. Its viewing angles and colors are also significantly better than TN but not as good as IPS in those two categories.

All good LED TVs(except OLED) are VA panels for this reason. Have you heard of the Samsung Quantum Dot LED panel? That is a VA panel for example.

This high contrast ratio also means that you will be able to use it in darker environments without making the blacks look like dark grey. Also, IPS panels have poor quality control and thus backlight bleed are common, but not so with VA panels.

Another thing is that 4k at any lower screen size will mean you will surely have to deal with the problems of windows scaling which may not be required for a 32inch screen."

835,3.6 out of 5,"I purchased this model not knowing it's a VA Panel. But then convinced me to use it. As soon as it's powered, I felt very bad buying this monitor. Firstly it was defective, there was an annoying green pattern on the display. In addition to that, Thunderbolt(USB C) did not work with MAC. After having a bad experience, called support to return the product. The support personnel wasn't patient enough, not even sympathetic. outright informed me to keep using the defective monitor. After a long escalation and multiple calls, finally, they accepted for replacement instead of return. Once again decided to give it a try. Received a second one, this time packaging and the box were in bad shape. Then anyway started to use the monitor. After an hour or two started noticing a green tint on the screen and the display going blank every 10 - 30 mins. It will remain there for over a second or two. It was really annoying as well. Then called the support and this time the support personal accepted the defect by seeing the picture and the return was completed.

839,4.1 out of 5,"I was on the lookout for this monitor since I saw Hardware Unboxed review and they were very impressed by its performance. Its one of the fastest IPS panels having lower overshoot similar to LG Nano IPS but with better contrast ratio. Out of the box the colors pop out. Some people may not like the oversaturated colors but I like this vibrance. There is a new firmware with a sRGB clamp, but I don't want to take a risk if that ruins the color vibrance I have now. There is a software OSD and you can control monitor settings without touching the monitor.

HDR is fine - what you can get with 350 nits of max brightness - for me its not as ""bad"" as some people make it out to be. I could see more vibrance in youtube HDR videos. I mean you don't need 1000 nits when you are sitting so close to the display - your eyes will complain.

The price MSI has fixed for it in India is ridiculous compared to what it retails for in the US. I got a good discount in the recent festival campaign Amazon is running. I got it because, to be honest, there isn't any other monitor around compared to this one. I got a Samsung G7 32"" a few months back and oh man even though it is a very fast VA panel, Samsung completely messed up Gsync with its firmware, also it had some color artefacts like some smearing I could still see even though people deny it. I concluded that VA technology is not ready for adaptive sync.

So went in for this one. To my surprise the black level uniformity is quite good compared to other IPS panels I have owned. Back light bleed is almost non existent. The first panel I got had one small dead pixel on top left. Amazon was kind enough to offer me a replacement and the second unit has no issues so far - touch wood.

The only other gripe I have is MSI put a Display Port version 1.2a, not 1.4. This limits 10 bit RGB at 1440p to 120 Hz. Above this refresh rate you have to drop the color depth to 8 bits. Not that we can notice the difference anyway :-)"

875,3.9 out of 5,"Took 5 days to ship but got the monitor today.

First impressions:
1. Nice colors
2. Love the ultra wide screen
3. Easy connectivity even with MacBook

Things I’m not happy about:
1. Very noticeable IPS flow, but we can’t really do anything about it. It happens with all IPS screens. Just wanted to mention that is a bit more noticeable when the screen completely goes black in movies or if you work on photo/video edits
2. While viewing from different angles, the colors are accurate, but the screen suffers a lot of glare and the IPS glow is even more noticeable then

There you go I have mentioned what I feel about this.

But I’m keeping this unit, cause IPS glow is just unavoidable. Hoping the monitor will perform great.

Video editing will be kickass ok this thing!!!"

879,4.3 out of 5,"The 27 inch monitor by Samsung is a great buy especially for work. It has an inbuilt eye saver mode which enables a blue light filter. The contrast ratio is good and picture quality is great. It's very bright when at full brightness so don't work in the dark with this at full throttle.

4 stars because they could have provided a HDMI cable instead of a VGA and also the port could have been vertical instead of horizontal connection which hinders placing close to the wall"

883,4.5 out of 5,"This is a good monitor and is really wide. The width could be fooling because the height is very very less and overall looks very small, smaller than a 19"" monitor which is a deal breaker for me. I couldnt return the product because Amazon didnt provide the return option and only can replace it, thats very disappointing. The clarity is amazing and the adjustments are great. People who do video editing will like the Ultra wide feature and the look and feel is great. But the size of the monitor is deceiving and its not for those who want a bigger monitor. Barring the size, its really wide and will be very helpful for those who need a wider screen. Other limitation is it doesnt have a VGA port and has only HDMI. Its Full HD and IPS which provides great clarity and ruggedness. Doesnt have inbuilt speakers..the wide looks feels cool..but size is something who should physically see before buying..seriously!. Great for those who love video editing, gaming. You will also see all other monitors as narrower after seeing this monitor. Could have been nice if the height is little greater."

887,4.3 out of 5,"LG has outdone themselves with the 27GL850 monitor. Although I had my eye on this specific model for a while now, I expected the pricing in India to be atrocious. However, I managed to snag one for way lower than I had anticipated. Very well worth the money spent!
Now, on to the monitor itself.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pros:
- Brilliant, vibrant colors.
- Excellent Color Gamut (you'll have to calibrate if you're working with color-sensitive content creation)
- Very wide viewing angles
- Ultra-low response times (well, mostly. See cons for more details). Thanks to LG's Nano IPS tech.

Cons:
- Advertised 1ms response time ('faster' mode) is quite useless as the overshoot is horrible. You'll be plagued by ghosting and inverse ghosting in fast-paced games. Bringing the response time down to 'fast' fixes these issues and doesn't result in too much of a response time penalty (drops to 4ms, which is still excellent for an IPS panel).
- The blacks on this monitor are sub-par. There's some bleed on the edges, and the blacks aren't as deep as I'm used to (coming from a Samsung QDot VA panel that had lovely blacks). But this doesn't mar the gaming experience one bit. If you're coming from anything other than a quality VA panel, you won't be disappointed.
- HDR, sadly, is a gimmick on this panel. The HDR mode manages to look worse than the standard modes with some content, and it hasn't even qualified the measly HDR400 certification. Leave this off, and stay away from this monitor if HDR factors into your purchase decision. However, at this price, I really can't complain.

Takeaways:
Don't use the marketed '1ms' response time mode. Set it to the 'Fast' mode and still enjoy a very snappy experience in all your games.
Please CALIBRATE your monitor. The factory calibration was quite terrible, and after a bit of tweaking, there was a significant improvement.
All in all, a very close-to-perfect monitor at this price range. Would recommend wholeheartedly if you can live with the cons listed above (I can)"

895,4.7 out of 5,"I am using this mount with my 32"", 6.7KG monitor for almost a week now. It is an authentic LUMI product, and it has been doing the job amazingly well. Exact details are not mentioned, but it seems to be made of some alloy of steel covered with matte finish paint.

The instructions manual had descriptive steps with pictures to put together the whole unit, and the hinges can be adjusted using the L-Keys (included inside the box). The box also has spare screws and washers for the monitor. The VESA plate being detachable makes it easier to move around your monitor, if required.

The base stand is quite sturdy, and it has rubber pads underneath it to avoid marks on the table. The main stand has an impressive circumference, and it does not wobble at all. The length of the main stand is reasonable too. For reference, I am 6'3"" and I have a few more inches on the stand to raise my monitor's height after setting it up at a convenient height while sitting. The three rotations mentioned in the description work like charm. Their friction can be adjusted using the L-Keys.

Overall, it is a good product for the price. If you have been looking for a mount for your setup, you won't regret buying it."

Personally I bought this screen for photo editing and coding. I was eyeing the Dell U2415. Below are some points that beat the Dell monitor.
Pros:
- Acurate color reproduction and super bright
- Solid build quality
- amazing clarity and sharpness. Only 2k monitor under 20k that produces accurate colors.
- Best pivot stand for both horizontal and vertal movement with height adjustment
- Factory calibrated as per ColorRec standards.
- Good software and setting options with color profiles
- Decent number of ports and connectivity.
- BenQ makes the best screens and overall a great IPS pannel with little back light bleeding (only in one corner)
-Decent speakers.
- solid stand with rubber grips.
- matte finish better than dell monitors
Cons:
- Thick bezels as compared to competition. Makes it less aesthetic. But who cares for that when you need an accurate monitor.
- thicker and heavier as compared to competition.
- No HDMI cable included in the box.

915,2.8 out of 5,"Review Based On One Week Usage:

- The product looks visually appealing.
- The controls are bit clumsy (a single button/knob) to control like a trackpad for all settings.
- The audio is not bad.
- The biggest problem is that the color depth seems to be missing. You always feel as if there is a white light reflecting on the screen. The images in 4K lack the color depth and no matter how much contrast/brightness you adjust, you always get a glare in your eyes. I use the second 4K monitor alongside but that doesn't have any such glare and the colors are soothing to the eyes and are more appealing.
- Everything looks to have a hue of white/green/yellow on this screen. I have already tried color temperature settings."

923,3.4 out of 5,"A great home office monitor. To be clear upfront, this is not for hard core gaming.
It's a good balanced allrounder. It has a great screen for media consumption and good for digital media designing in terms of the colour. Here it's not too much, not too little, pop in colour will allow you as a professional to be assured that the image or video produced on this screen will not be that much different when viewed on any other screen.
Connectivity is what I was looking for and connectivity is what I got... Great stand functions, provided you have a sturdy desk as it does tend to shake especially when the screen is at the highest.
A bit heavy and cannot be considered slim, infact it does take up alot of real-estate on the desk (from the back of the stand to the front of the screen).
It is not really borderless. The sides and top appear to be borderless when the screen is off, but, turn it on and the border is very much there. So this is not an edge to edge display, it just has a very nice in-glass finish giving rise to that notion.
Will be getting another one soon to setup my dual screen workstation.
For me, this is the best in budget, all things considered, including the companies reputation for service (: fingers crossed :)"

1. Display is good for office use. I have not tried it for gaming.
2. The anti glare works fine
3. adjustable stand works as mentioned and the stand assembly is quick and easy (no additional tools needed)

Cons
1. I received two power adapters but none of it works for Indian wall socket. One is a 250V Chinese plug pins (big one) and the second one has very weird pins (not sure which country uses this type of plug). If I am ordering the product in India, I expect an Indian plug / adapter. The power rating on the back of the monitor suggested it supports 230V so I have to put an additional travel pin adapter to plug it to the wall socket.
2. There is no standard HDMI cable included with the box. There is a cable which looks similar but it is bigger in size and has a different shape. I had to use a spare HDMI cable that I had.
3. The sound from the speaker is very low. I am not sure if it is a problem with this unit alone or this is how it is supposed to sound. I can barely hear the sound from the monitor speaker. The sound is lower than those of my laptop speaker.
4. The product details in Amazon are incorrect. The product is ""Made in China"" and not in India as advertised."

991,3.2 out of 5,Good second screen but with issues. Firstly it doesnt work with older laptops even with usb c port. This only works with usb + alt mode compatible laptops. Secondly it doesnt work with game consoles like nintendo switch etc. But if you are using a latest macbook or latest windows system it works flawlessly.

995,5 out of 5,"Hey gamers, this Asus vg248qe is for you folks. If anyone wanting this for editing or office work please refrain from buying this. I'm saying this because such work doesn't require 144hz ref rate and 1ms response time. Aur fir aankhein bhi kharab karoge 😆
It's a true gaming monitor with great features like realtime crosshair placement in games. 1ms response time is super and 144hz gives you smooth mouse movement.
Remember, if you buying this, your GPU should be capable of giving the same render rate like upto 100 or 144hz render rate to your monitor. Otherwise no matter you set it at 144 or 100hz. If you are using 1050ti , it doesn't going to give you a smooth performance. Because in latest games the GPU won't push above 65hz render rate that matches the monitor's ref rate and chances are you will encounter with image tearing and lag.
If you are planning to upgrade your card to 1060 6gb or above, this monitor gives you mindblowing performance and smoothness.

For the cons, the screen has too much brightness so I recommend you not using it for heavy hours, give your eyes some rest in between.

You can also change color modes in it, has almost 6 diff color modes Osd has good options to set the monitor's colors and contrast as per your taste.
Bulit quality is solid, the back bracket for cable management is quite worthy.

The monitor is height adjutable and tiltable to certain degree, yoy should avoid monitors those do not have heigh adjustable function. Just because most of the gaming monitors have TN panels and so it's necessary to adjust them as per your eye level so that you can avoid washing out colors.

You can rotate it to 45 degree left and right.
So it's all from my point of view friends, have queations? Shoot a message me here and I would love to answer you. Like the review? Give me a thumbs up and 😻 like 👍"

I received the monitor as agreed in 2 days.
I was using laptop earlier and due considering WFH - I purchased this monitor for office work.
As far as office work use - I am fully satisfied. Those who are WFH and using laptop screen, guys, Please switch to monitor like this considering eye care.
I am not gaming fan so can not comment on same. The youTube quality was okay to good.

Why did purchased this product:
1. Budget: I do not wanted to go beyond 9000 Rs.
2. Size: I dont want to have more than 22 inch size. Can our eyes catch more than that?
3. Technical: I wanted IPS panel (for sure) - 100% Recommended
4. Ports: One HDMI was sufficient for my laptop ( 1 VGA is bonus)
5. Country of Origin of this product is India ( Yes, Of course my preference)

Cons:
No USB port ( Why do we need?)
No speakers ( Why did WFH need it?) Laptop has speakers!"

1014,4.4 out of 5,"Theres like nothing to complain about this monitor rather than the build quality which is okayish nothing great but when it comes to the pannel its perfect. Let me give you guys a brief overview about this monitor as there aren't many reviews on this.

This monitor is really underrate as compared to its price, I wasn't specifically looking for a 240hz but the price caught my attention. I have been playing on 60hz for like 4-5 years and i was MGE in CSGO when I used to play on 60hz now i switched my game preference but after getting the monitor the first game i launched was cs and there was a night and day difference between 60 to 240hz. I was mind blown of how much i am able to perceive now. The first rank i got was mg1 i guess after not playing cs for so long rusted my mechanics of the game but thats okay. Apart for personal brag XD , there's some things i would like to add up. There no back light stobing mode in this monitor which reduces the blur personally I dont like it as it makes me dizzy and gives me headache, if you are habituated on playing this mode then theres is none in this one. Then the Overdrive modes, there are three fast, super fast and extreme. Extreme is completely useless then comes the super fast which is good but still there was some amount of over shoot but the perfect one is the fast(1/3) and thats the best Overdrive setting. For brightness and contrast its pretty bright I keep it at 90 brightness and 70 contrast. Lastly for presets the standard is good for working but for gaming I strongly suggest the FPS mode and Balck boost to 3/3 it gives life to a game and everything is so much clearer. For other miscellaneous stuff like usb hubs its okay i dont use them but having a function like that give some ease. And if you want to play fps title please turn off amd freesync and G-sync. Other than that simply this is one of best 240 hz in this budget and theres nothing to complain about. You can blindly trust the Dell on this product. And sorry to mention the IPS pannel and colour quality. I used to play on VA pannel and this is my first IPS pannel and colours seems good to me. I don't know much about colour and colour grading work so no suggestions about that for gaming i already mentioned everything i had to say. Thank You."

1034,4.4 out of 5,"I bought it for 8200.
Pros:
1) 2019 Model
2) Anti-glare
3)Low-blue light feature
4)Good resolution for a 21.5""(if you know what I mean)
Cons:
1) Not stylish unlike the 22es.
2) Not wall-mountable.
3) 14ms response time (expected for an IPS panel)
UPDATE 0:
The screen dims and brightens for a fraction of a second every now and then.
UPDATE 1:
Just got the replacement today.
Even this has the same problem.
It looks like it's an inherent problem in this model.
I'm guessing the condition might worsen with time.
Reply if you notice it too.
UPDATE 2:
The flicker is actually a thing in this model. If you are someone like me who gets annoyed with the flickering then you should buy a monitor with flicker-free technology.
I returned this product for BenQ 24"" which comes with flicker-free technology."

1040,4 out of 5," The product was delivered on 1st April 2021 and i started having dead pixels issue on 13th April, I complained regarding that to LG customer service and they visited for review on the same day.
Their statement was there need to be more dead pixels on screen only than we can request replacement.
This is so dump, You are buying 60K monitor for editorial work and have to sit close to the monitor and every time you see dead pixels in front of your eyes.
Very poor customer service. My issue have been escalated further cause i told them no matter what i need new display. While buying how a customer knows that if in future they are having dead pixel issue there need to be 7 dead pixels for replacement? Then i would never buy it in the first place. They should mention every detail.
Also i checked their warranty policy and there is noting in written about dead pixels. So are they making us fools?
Good for you guys if you are reading this review don't buy this monitor, better go for other brand."

It even comes with screen protectors. It came with 3 different cords, a charging block thing, 2 sceen protectors, a magnetic case thing (this one is junk or I don' t know how to use it properly so I will be looking for a new one), and a manual that is easy to read and has descriptions on what cord is compatible with what. For my personal laptop I use the USB C to USB C cord. For my telework computer I use the charging block, USB C to regular USB, and the HDMI cable.

It came with 3 different cords, a charging block thing, 2 sceen protectors, a magnetic case thing (this one is junk or I don' t know how to use it properly so I will be looking for a new one), and a manual that is easy to read and has descriptions on what cord is compatible with what. For my personal laptop I use the USB C to USB C cord. For my telework computer I use the charging block, USB C to regular USB, and the HDMI cable. I really like that I didn't have to buy cables for this one! Other than the magnetic thing not working well, I really like the quality/picture/sound/weight of this monitor!"

1087,4.1 out of 5,"The display quality is excellent. The material quality is good. The monitor is stable. The flexible tilt and height adjustment allow you to set it up perfect for your needs.

Cons: Speaker quality is average. The control buttons located on the bottom panel are very difficult to access and a nightmare to navigate. But once you manage to configure it to your needs, you dont need to keep tinkering hopefully.

Overall, a quality product from Philips"
