7,4.2,I have bought this product in a hurry since I can get it delivered within a day with flipkart first. There was only 1 in stock and I was just in time in grabbing the opportunity. The range is fabulous and passes through more than 3 doors into my cabin. Am pleasantly surprised at the ease of use of the interface. The dual antenna coverage is really good. I am currently using it with ACT Broadband.
8,4.3,"Product is just awesome and very easy to configure. Working like a charm :)

But .....
1. I felt that range is slightly low.

2. This is not the latest version of TL-WA850RE.. . Flipkart is selling TL-WA850RE V1.26, and it doesn't support ''TP-LINK THETER'' (mob app to controle wifi extender). . . . It would be better if flipkart sells TL-WA850RE v2+"

10,4.2,nice product ok range nice build in quality. simple to install modern software interface can use as router or extender directly. but lots of time speed automatically slow down in LAN connection and WiFi network disappearance. need to restart router frequently. don't buy it. even my old TP-LINK TL-WR841N working very good as compare to this model. very disappoints from ttp-link.
11,4.1,Very light weight. The range is good enough. Only one thing that it does not support the thetre app by tp-link so you have manage it through a browser. Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.
12,4.1,On a 75mbps connection I'm getting 88 mbps speed on 5ghz channel and around 35 mbps on 2.4 ghz channel. The product itself is very easy to install and does a great job. I have a 2 bedroom apartment and the range is pretty good even extending to the balcony.

Has dual antennas which helps in transmitting signals throughout your house.
Awesome product and easy to setup.

16,4.3,The Good Is Worth Its Value. Happy to Have this Router with pretty Fast delivery. Purpose accomplished without hassle. In Market At Home.Covers considerable area and i shall recommend everyone who is willing to buy Router for home/ office use. So far undoubtedly doubtless product.
17,4,"Straight forward, I have 40mbps plan and it works well. It also works without lan cable. And best for considering the price of a repeater. Cheapest available and does its job."

20,4.1,Not a good product. 5ghz band works good for shorter range but 2.4 ghz band although covering good range doesn't give good speed. I have 100Mbps plan and 2.4 ghz band gives about 20~25 Mbps speed in 5m distance from router which is very poor . For this I purchased a new router tp link archer c6 and its 2.4 and 5 ghz bands works fantabulous.So if anyone intersted in purchasing a good router overall buy tp link c6 as it supports mesh network.

NOTE:
-- The performance largely depends on the correct positioning of the extender. The effect on speed and latency depends on the strength of the original signal received by the repeater.

25,4.7,Not providing good signals
26,4.1,Awesome product from TPlink. My wifi router from d-link was not that good in range so i bought this now internet connection works great all over the house. Installing this device was not hard at all and speed is good almost as same as I get from router. 5 star product.
27,4,"So okay listen there were so many options available around this range like D-link, Tp-Link etc. There is gonna be confusion in between them. If you have a bit more price range then me, definately go for the Tenda Router. But if its somewhere between 900-1300 , I would prefer you to take this router into consideration too. It has four antennas which is not available in any other brand available in this price range. It has a good warranty period. Because of the four antenna model , it's penetra..."
28,4.2,"This is a very good router which provide very stable and fast ADSL Broadband connection both on my BSNL and Airtel Network. Those who complain about the configuration should know a bit of computernew lineetwork terminologies, otherwise the set-up a bit harder than other modems. However set-up will not take more than 30 Seconds. Better not to use the Start-up CD.

29,4.2,"Its design is very attractive. Range and speed is very good. I bought it during unlock for work from home purpose. Delivery was timely as per commitment. Its perfect to use for multiple devices. I use it for my 2chidrens online class. Its supporting 1 laptop, 1desktop, 3 mobile, 2tab at a time without speed drop. My house has 4 rooms and I got range in all four rooms."

Using as wifi extender. Really easy to setup just change mode of use and follow the instructions. Anyone can install it in 10 minutes."
31,4.6,Very nice very good best quality I like it
32,4.2,"I did lots and lots and lots of research on all the models available in the sub-3K range, and the good ones constantly popping up were the d-link and the tp-link modems.
I decided to go with TP-link W8961- reasons being
1) Dual antenna - these are effective, and I am now getting signal strengths of 4/5 where I used to get 1-2/5 previously. These are through at least 3 walls.
2)No signal drop till now, this little wonder box has managed to hold onto the ADSL signal without problems.
3)Cost eff..."
33,4.2,"Everything works as expected but for a 3 antenna router it seems to have a lesser coverage area. Not sure though maybe because of its positioning. I am pretty Satisfied with its performance.

1 star less for the delivery. Really took a long time to deliver never expected this from flipkart."
34,3.8,"Slightly expensive, but still it works absolutely fine. If you want to use internet inside your house go for it. Any SIM CARD will work fine. I am using it where jio network does not work in Mobile but works fine in this router.Getting speed upto 8 mbps with one bar of network. Loved it. üëç"
35,3.9,Not enough range for 2bhk infact my old wifi router of iball was able to give wifi network till end of my room which had 2 antenna. I bought this one thinking it will cover my entire flat but seems antenna are showpiece. Sad with product for network coverage
36,4.1,"I am happy with the purchase... Thank you flipkart for providing quality products. This is my second purchase of tplink product via flipkart.

The device is able to handle big network without any lag... wifi range is also good. + It's future ready with wifi 6. Speed on wifi is Awesome.."
37,4.3,"Its been one year 6 months and counting without any issue , perfect for 3bhk house to cover complete house end to end . working good till now without much issue .

Mostly all feature are available when used as routing mode , best way to have ethernet cable connection for ISP service connection to take advantage of complete feature .

Working perfect with Airtel ISP as well ."
38,4.9,"Not worth for it's cost. It works just like usual range extender. I have Mi range extender, both works same. Only thing is it has dual band, but when it comes to range, 5Ghz will work at certain small distance. Costly but not worth."
39,4.1,A very good quality product and WiFi extended network is accessible and easy to set up. Worth and value for money. Thanks a lot for Flipkart for making these wonderful product available and quickly delivering to home during lockdown period. Appreciate quick delivery and competitive product price. Easily connected with my Airtel broadband Dlink DSL 224 WPS WiFi router modem in Mysore City. You can view WiFi green light on attached photo.
40,4,"Works really well as a stand-alone router and a mesh node. You can connect t it directly to your modem or Ethernet cable. You only need your phone app to set it up. The best part is that you only need to connect the Ethernet cable to the primary Deco and it is up. Even if you want to add more Decos, you just need to plug it in and keep it wherever you want without worrying about the Ethernet cable. The primary node connects with others wirelessly and provides the same signal strength through ..."
41,4.5,"Works well as a wifi repeater/range extender but gets very hot after some time. MediaShare and usb storage mode is great, supports most external hard drives one at a time. This is a great device during travel for short term use, can be powered from a power bank and you can access your pen drives /hard drives from any phone/laptop. If you're looking for a router/range extender better go for a dedicated router, it will cost less and will be more durable. This device is a great all rounder."
42,3.9,Good
43,4.1,"I will not go into technical aspects or other details. In layman language, I brought it after reading and watching all videos. It‚Äôs not worth the price and hype. I‚Äôm using it in 920 Sqft apartment with no obstacles wall. 5G has very poor signal strength & 2.4 ghz has not specified speed. Remember that for better Internet Speed and coverage your host device must also has excellent NIC. I‚Äôm using it for PS4 & Smart TV in which I‚Äôm not getting expected value.

44,4.3,"Superb repeater. One of the best products you can buy to increase your Wi-Fi footprint, I use this for my 3500sqft flat single level. I got 2 of them and every corner has strong 5ghz Wi-Fi. I get 5MBps speeds from my laptop to other laptop data transfer."
45,4,Works fine with a very good coverage across the rooms. Very well works for 100 mbps connection or more. Buy it during offer days for a good price.
46,4.1,This is really a nice product. I configured it in juat one minute. Its super easy to install as well.
47,4.5,Best router in the world ü•∞üòç
48,4.8,Nice
49,4.1,"I bought the router in Big Billion sale and received prompt delivery. Product as such is decent but nothing exceptional. The coverage on 5g is at best medicore and unlike TP link which really has a long range on different floor level too.

Performance is acceptable with periodic burst of 200 mbps basis fibre connection speed. Set up is very easy for any regular user."
50,4,"Awesome Router and very fast, highly powered for multiple devices.
Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

But the range is definetly better than other routers i used. and speed is good even in corners of my home."
51,4.3,Performance upto the mark. Band locking option is fabulous
52,3.9,"Very gud device, much better then netgear"
53,4.2,"For this price point the product is okay. Take note of few things below....1) This device doesn't support wireless bridge, u can't bridge it with any other wifi network. 2) WiFi range is poor its average only not good. 3) Heats up significantly if operating it on dual band ie. Both bands active simultaneously. 4) The device hardware is V2. 0 5) Supports 2 TB HDD without any issue. 6) Build quality is perfect and it's best in the segment from price and features point of view, if u are not both..."

61,4,"Go for it very useful and affordable
Iam living in village this is useful to browse net inside house also and we can also make wifi calls if we have jio or Airtel Simi using WiFi calling option"
62,3.9,Great device. Good speeds. Although installation does not tell where to plug the cable provided with the product. I had to search YouTube videos to find out and plugged it to a free usb inbuilt port in the motherboard. It also has an extra bracket for mini itx board form factor.
63,3.7,This is the future of routers. Go eyes closed if you want a scalable wifi setup and forget it is there. It is a enterprise grade solution. The Trend Micro protection is added benefit. I am running over 20 devices on a two router setup.
64,4.7,"I required a new router to get better signal to my room in first floor. Old router was intermittently failing, throughput was also less.
Morever, all of us working, studying from home, put a strain on existing device. Hence needed a better Wifi router.

After lot of research on internet for suitable router and going through no of reviews. Finally settled for Asus RT-86U 3000 Mbps router
It is an excellent choice, setup took less than 30 seconds in moving from existing router to Asus. Tip : P..."
65,4.3,"Great Product. Speacially if you have lan connection across your house then this really works well. I have 5 Decos connected accross the house via LAN and the ethernet backhaul works really well to give consistent speed every where.

If you dont have LAN then mesh connection over wifi may not be as great."
66,4.6,"The product is great and now my house of 2400 sqft is fully covered with wifi, no dropping of signal and able to watch everything in FHD and 4K.

The installation is seamless and the app works fantastically giving all the connection information, data consumed etc etc as mentioned in the product description.

93,4,Not a good product. 5ghz band works good for shorter range but 2.4 ghz band although covering good range doesn't give good speed. I have 100Mbps plan and 2.4 ghz band gives about 20~25 Mbps speed in 5m distance from router which is very poor . For this I purchased a new router tp link archer c6 and its 2.4 and 5 ghz bands works fantabulous.So if anyone intersted in purchasing a good router overall buy tp link c6 as it supports mesh network.

Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

But the range is definetly better than other routers i used. and speed is good even in corners of my home."

156,4.1,Very light weight. The range is good enough. Only one thing that it does not support the thetre app by tp-link so you have manage it through a browser. Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.

I am currently using it with ACT Broadband.

But .....
1. I felt that range is slightly low.

2. This is not the latest version of TL-WA850RE.. . Flipkart is selling TL-WA850RE V1.26, and it doesn't support ''TP-LINK THETER'' (mob app to controle wifi extender). . . . It would be better if flipkart sells TL-WA850RE v2+"

227,4.3,nice product ok range nice build in quality. simple to install modern software interface can use as router or extender directly. but lots of time speed automatically slow down in LAN connection and WiFi network disappearance. need to restart router frequently. don't buy it. even my old TP-LINK TL-WR841N working very good as compare to this model. very disappoints from ttp-link.
228,4.4,Very light weight. The range is good enough. Only one thing that it does not support the thetre app by tp-link so you have manage it through a browser. Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.

Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

For this I purchased a new router tp link archer c6 and its 2.4 and 5 ghz bands works fantabulous.So if anyone intersted in purchasing a good router overall buy tp link c6 as it supports mesh network.

1. I felt that range is slightly low.

2. This is not the latest version of TL-WA850RE.. . Flipkart is selling TL-WA850RE V1.26, and it doesn't support ''TP-LINK THETER'' (mob app to controle wifi extender). . . . It would be better if flipkart sells TL-WA850RE v2+"

Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.

For this I purchased a new router tp link archer c6 and its 2.4 and 5 ghz bands works fantabulous.So if anyone intersted in purchasing a good router overall buy tp link c6 as it supports mesh network.

Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

If you're looking for a router/range extender better go for a dedicated router, it will cost less and will be more durable. This device is a great all rounder."

705,4.3,"Awesome Router and very fast, highly powered for multiple devices.
Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

But the range is definetly better than other routers i used. and speed is good even in corners of my home."

I am currently using it with ACT Broadband.

But .....
1. I felt that range is slightly low.

2. This is not the latest version of TL-WA850RE.. . Flipkart is selling TL-WA850RE V1.26, and it doesn't support ''TP-LINK THETER'' (mob app to controle wifi extender). . . . It would be better if flipkart sells TL-WA850RE v2+"

812,4.3,Very light weight. The range is good enough. Only one thing that it does not support the thetre app by tp-link so you have manage it through a browser. Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.

For this I purchased a new router tp link archer c6 and its 2.4 and 5 ghz bands works fantabulous.So if anyone intersted in purchasing a good router overall buy tp link c6 as it supports mesh network.

Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

But the range is definetly better than other routers i used. and speed is good even in corners of my home."

Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

But the range is definetly better than other routers i used. and speed is good even in corners of my home."

1. I felt that range is slightly low.

2. This is not the latest version of TL-WA850RE.. . Flipkart is selling TL-WA850RE V1.26, and it doesn't support ''TP-LINK THETER'' (mob app to controle wifi extender). . . . It would be better if flipkart sells TL-WA850RE v2+"

Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.

1176,4.9,nice product ok range nice build in quality. simple to install modern software interface can use as router or extender directly. but lots of time speed automatically slow down in LAN connection and WiFi network disappearance. need to restart router frequently. don't buy it. even my old TP-LINK TL-WR841N working very good as compare to this model. very disappoints from ttp-link.
1177,4.1,Very light weight. The range is good enough. Only one thing that it does not support the thetre app by tp-link so you have manage it through a browser. Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.

Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

But the range is definetly better than other routers i used. and speed is good even in corners of my home."

2. This is not the latest version of TL-WA850RE.. . Flipkart is selling TL-WA850RE V1.26, and it doesn't support ''TP-LINK THETER'' (mob app to controle wifi extender). . . . It would be better if flipkart sells TL-WA850RE v2+"

1249,3.9,nice product ok range nice build in quality. simple to install modern software interface can use as router or extender directly. but lots of time speed automatically slow down in LAN connection and WiFi network disappearance. need to restart router frequently. don't buy it. even my old TP-LINK TL-WR841N working very good as compare to this model. very disappoints from ttp-link.
1250,4.1,Very light weight. The range is good enough. Only one thing that it does not support the thetre app by tp-link so you have manage it through a browser. Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.
1251,4.3,On a 75mbps connection I'm getting 88 mbps speed on 5ghz channel and around 35 mbps on 2.4 ghz channel. The product itself is very easy to install and does a great job. I have a 2 bedroom apartment and the range is pretty good even extending to the balcony.

Signal is also very good for a 3BHK house, have not tested beyond.

Since our indian houses are Brick and Mortar and wood in USA/Europe, dont expect the range the routers mention.

Not their fault, they test in different conditions and our indian homes are brick and mortar difficult to give comparable range.

But the range is definetly better than other routers i used. and speed is good even in corners of my home."

I am currently using it with ACT Broadband.

But .....
1. I felt that range is slightly low.

2. This is not the latest version of TL-WA850RE.. . Flipkart is selling TL-WA850RE V1.26, and it doesn't support ''TP-LINK THETER'' (mob app to controle wifi extender). . . . It would be better if flipkart sells TL-WA850RE v2+"

1468,4.1,nice product ok range nice build in quality. simple to install modern software interface can use as router or extender directly. but lots of time speed automatically slow down in LAN connection and WiFi network disappearance. need to restart router frequently. don't buy it. even my old TP-LINK TL-WR841N working very good as compare to this model. very disappoints from ttp-link.
1469,4,Very light weight. The range is good enough. Only one thing that it does not support the thetre app by tp-link so you have manage it through a browser. Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.

I am currently using it with ACT Broadband.

But .....
1. I felt that range is slightly low.

2. This is not the latest version of TL-WA850RE.. . Flipkart is selling TL-WA850RE V1.26, and it doesn't support ''TP-LINK THETER'' (mob app to controle wifi extender). . . . It would be better if flipkart sells TL-WA850RE v2+"

1763,4.3,Very light weight. The range is good enough. Only one thing that it does not support the thetre app by tp-link so you have manage it through a browser. Easy setup and the guest network feature is just amazing. You can also fix a usage time for the guests. Overall the product is good and worth buying. It looks better than the image show by flipkart.
1764,4.3,On a 75mbps connection I'm getting 88 mbps speed on 5ghz channel and around 35 mbps on 2.4 ghz channel. The product itself is very easy to install and does a great job. I have a 2 bedroom apartment and the range is pretty good even extending to the balcony.

1768,4,Not a good product. 5ghz band works good for shorter range but 2.4 ghz band although covering good range doesn't give good speed.

1822,4.2,"The product is great and now my house of 2400 sqft is fully covered with wifi, no dropping of signal and able to watch everything in FHD and 4K.

The installation is seamless and the app works fantastically giving all the connection information, data consumed etc etc as mentioned in the product description.

Recommend for purchase."
1823,4.3,"Writing this review after 7 days of heavy usage.

I purchased Tenda AC10, D-link 825 and TP-Link Archer C60 and none of them are upto the mark,

Tenda AC10 has range issues, though they claim that AC10 has beam-forming but not upto the mark

D-Link 825 has wifi drop issue, I tried 2 routers and they did not perform well. The router you get is made for Russia which was discontinued and Dlink customized the firmware and imported. The only advantage of this is it has USB drive which can help you..."

1825,4.1,great if you are looking for a great plug and play mesh router. stay away if you like to fiddle with settings a lot. took me 5 mins to set up and I have not touched it since
