359,4.3,Fantastic phone. I loved it. Looks better then the photos in showcase. I will suggest this phone to People who are looking for a good budget phone. But the camera is not that good. The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience.

Camera is by far the best among all other phones. Wide angle lens is quite accurate with colours and distortion is manageable. Portrait AI is good. HDR gives a sense of false positivity but makes the picture looks better compared to a dslr.

439,4.3,Fantastic phone. I loved it. Looks better then the photos in showcase. I will suggest this phone to People who are looking for a good budget phone. But the camera is not that good. The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience. (Better then redmi) It doesn't have any ads.

Camera is by far the best among all other phones. Wide angle lens is quite accurate with colours and distortion is manageable. Portrait AI is good. HDR gives a sense of false positivity but makes the picture looks better compared to a dslr.

839,4.3,Fantastic phone. I loved it. Looks better then the photos in showcase. I will suggest this phone to People who are looking for a good budget phone. But the camera is not that good. The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience. (Better then redmi) It doesn't have any ads.

1239,4.3,Fantastic phone. I loved it. Looks better then the photos in showcase. I will suggest this phone to People who are looking for a good budget phone. But the camera is not that good. The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience. (Better then redmi) It doesn't have any ads.

The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience. (Better then redmi) It doesn't have any ads.

1397,4.3,Good products
1398,4.3,Fantastic phone. I loved it. Looks better then the photos in showcase. I will suggest this phone to People who are looking for a good budget phone. But the camera is not that good. The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience. (Better then redmi) It doesn't have any ads.
1399,4.3,"Earlier I used a small smart phone of 8 GB internal storage and 1 GB RAM. I used it for more than 5 years! Now that I have started to use this smart phone with 64 GB internal storage and 4 GB RAM. Wow! What a difference! Though it is just 2/3 days only, I feel immense difference."
1400,4.3,"Battery : is best
Display : Perfect
Sound : on speaker low but Okay
Performance : Awful, phone is superslow.. if you ever use 4GB/6GB ram phone then you realise how pathetic ... Older 3/32 still better than this..
Camera : Front is awful, like 3k china phone
Back : like old 3MP camera. Do not expect photography.

Earphone : Not include.
