I bought this smartwatch during big billion sale and got it at a very cheap price. The initial impression was superb. This model is best for those who are having thin wrist.

Pros:
1. Small and compact size.
2. Numerous activity tracking (though I'm not sure whether all are accurate or not. I've checked only walking. While walk, I kept my phone GPS on with me and it provided nearly accurate data).

4,4.2,It's a very catchy watch that noise has released at this price point giving out so much features which you only get in high range smartwatches. The display is the main highlight. Haven't seen any display like this so far on any budget smartwatch. It's so slim. Not a bit bulky like its other competitors. It really is a awesome watch.

613,4.1,It's a very catchy watch that noise has released at this price point giving out so much features which you only get in high range smartwatches. The display is the main highlight. Haven't seen any display like this so far on any budget smartwatch. It's so slim. Not a bit bulky like its other competitors. It really is a awesome watch.

I bought this smartwatch during big billion sale and got it at a very cheap price. The initial impression was superb. This model is best for those who are having thin wrist.

Pros:
1. Small and compact size.
2. Numerous activity tracking (though I'm not sure whether all are accurate or not. I've checked only walking. While walk, I kept my phone GPS on with me and it provided nearly accurate data).

Pros-

Design n build quality is excellent.

1106,4.1,It's a very catchy watch that noise has released at this price point giving out so much features which you only get in high range smartwatches. The display is the main highlight. Haven't seen any display like this so far on any budget smartwatch. It's so slim. Not a bit bulky like its other competitors. It really is a awesome watch.

1)A very classy and attractive watch.
2)Accurate steps count.
3)Light weight.
4)Good strap quality.
cons-
1)Heart sensor is not at all accurate ..it will give false reading most of the time.

3)The message notification and call notification has a very poor presentable display theme ,it feels like you are using a 200 rs cheap product.
4)while controlling your music player..."

He also took a pic showing its accuracy to check the oxygen level. I think one must give it a try. Thank you flipkart for the sassy product."
1113,4.1,"First day first sale product and the watch is amazing. The design and build quality is good not the best but for the price it's justify able. The important thing is the features it provides. The step count and activity tracker is not accurate to be honest but rest everything works perfectly fine. It's not a major upgrade from Realme Watch or the watch s and watch s master edition. But as a new product it's okay. The realme watch , watch 2 , watch s and watch watch s master edition all are sam..."

Nice display.. Amoled would have been better though
Activity tracker works fine.. Step counting is very precise

1122,4.3,"After using it for 1 month, here is my review:

1. After charging realme Watch S to 100% it will be at 100% for 3-4 consecutive days (based on my usage).
2. The sensors are very accurate. I tested it out with original heart rate monitor and oxygen level monitor. I got the same results as on both the machines.
3. Within 1¬Ω-2 hours, it will be fully charged.
4. The watch will work for 15-20 days under light load (turning off settings like CHR monitor, sedentary alert) and max. 5-7 days if the ..."
1123,4.3,"Excellent watch at this price point..
All functinlons work properly.. but the calling speaker volume is less then Timex fit 2.0 as I have both watches so compared it..
But otherwise volume & features are good with good display.. AI/siri function works well.. I like the knob on the right side of the watch.. watch & steel frame looks premium.. & it is very light weight also.. must buy if u r looking for bluetooth calling watch at this price point.."
