And if you are looking for an “Indian made” smartwatch with almost all features then your search ends here.

I bought this smartwatch during big billion sale and got it at a very cheap price. The initial impression was superb. This model is best for those who are having thin wrist.

Pros:
1. Small and compact size.
2. Numerous activity tracking (though I'm not sure whether all are accurate or not. I've checked only walking. While walk, I kept my phone GPS on with me and it provided nearly accurate data).

4,4.2,It's a very catchy watch that noise has released at this price point giving out so much features which you only get in high range smartwatches. The display is the main highlight. Haven't seen any display like this so far on any budget smartwatch. It's so slim. Not a bit bulky like its other competitors. It really is a awesome watch.

838,4.3,It's a very catchy watch that noise has released at this price point giving out so much features which you only get in high range smartwatches. The display is the main highlight. Haven't seen any display like this so far on any budget smartwatch. It's so slim. Not a bit bulky like its other competitors. It really is a awesome watch.

I bought this smartwatch during big billion sale and got it at a very cheap price. The initial impression was superb. This model is best for those who are having thin wrist.

Pros:
1. Small and compact size.
2. Numerous activity tracking (though I'm not sure whether all are accurate or not. I've checked only walking. While walk, I kept my phone GPS on with me and it provided nearly accurate data).

2. The sensors are very accurate. I tested it out with original heart rate monitor and oxygen level monitor. I got the same results as on both the machines.

Pros-

Design n build quality is excellent.

Leather belt looks elegant and suits to your style.

Amoled display is plus point which is very much impressive at this point range. Brightness is good and also visible in direct sunlight.

User interface is also good but could have better.
