4,4.4 out of 5,"Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets see

PROS
1. Its easy to use
2. Decent battery backup
3. Live mode operation is not lagging.

CONS
1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.
2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.
3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.
4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.
5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk
6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject
7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.
I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.
In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.

I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.
Its not worth for money"

8,4.5 out of 5,"I got this camera after seeing rave reviews in YouTube. However, this review will focus on the shortcomings only. I discovered after 10 days of use.
1. Poor battery life : does not last even 3 hours of use. However, this is compensated by the extra battery provided. But the way battery compartment is designed does no good to the purpose. you need to unscrew from mount to change The battery. So you will need to break your schedule in case u are shooting something continuous.
2. Error Error - the dreaded E:62:10 error appeared in my camera after few days of use. Although I did not face any difficulty in shooting. It did make my experience bitter. Could not resolve though the solutions available on internet. The usual switch on of. Change battery etc does not work and the error message is a part of the display now.
3. Mic : even tough the mic is a strong one. It does not do well to reduce background noise.
4. Charging time : 150 mins. This really restricts ur ability to shoot and u need to plan ahead if you are a serious vlogger.
5. Not weather proof. : the manual says it is not weather proof and small amounts of water may damage the internal circuits. I mean why? It restricts your ability to take outdoor shoot and a vlogger would not take this.

Apart from the above. The camera delivers what it promises in the review videos.

Update :
My lens assembly was faulty. Thankfully Sony service centre was open and as directed by the Sony representative, I gave the camera for repair. It took 14 days to get the part from abroad and complete the repairs. Now, the camera is working fine. No issues as such.
Update 2: Please go through the settings and understand each setting before shooting. There are a lot of helpful YouTube videos on this camera.
Update 3 : The camera worked fine for 2 days after repairs. As of now it is still in the repair shop. 2 months after purchase the camera is 28 days.(and counting) in repair shop. Even after 2 trips of repair shop the error does not go away. Now it is a permanent display in my camera.
Update 4: Sony had finally replaced the camera with a new one. Will update if there are issues in the new one. From mid September to mid December the camera was in the repair centre for at least 50 days before it was finally replaced."

Image quality is not good in this camera comparing to the ones taken from base Canon dslrs, with same lens, 18-135 and same settings. High resolution just for publicity. Low light performance is worst.
Beware before spending more than a lakh on this."

43,3.4 out of 5,"The spec is printed as 50x50 on the bino, but forget that. Cheap Chinese binoculars have all nonsense specs printed on them, it doesn't matter.

The true way to deduce the magnification of a bino is first to measure the objective lens and the exit pupil accurately with a ruler, then divide the first with the latter.
The objective lens is 47-48 cms, not perfect 50cms; 6 cms exit pupil.

(48 cms objective lens / 6 cms exit pupil) = 8 magnification.
So, it's a 8x48 binocular at best, not even 20x50.

Now, the image is clear and almost as bright as with naked eyes, and the field of vision is naturally wide. BUT, since it's only 8x magnification, the image will not be significantly bigger than that of naked eyes and the viewer will always be a little disappointed and will wish they could see a bit more details.
For example, you can read a number-plate of a bike 200m away, but you won't be able to read the label on a water-tank situated on the roof of a building twice that far.

**For 1980 Rs, I would say it's a value for money, but you won't use it much, it will mostly rest inside your cupboard. It's probably good for a teen beginner with keener eyes, but not for an adult."

59,4.6 out of 5,"This is my first high-quality camera. And, I am still exploring.
Image quality and video quality seem really good.
The full rotatable touch screen, mic input, and good user interface make it a very good deal for me, as I plan to do personal content creation.

I considered the Sony a5100 as an option, but could not make the compromises and got this instead. But, the Sony a5100/6000 is great value for money even today, if you want it only for still photography.

I got the m50 at around 51k on Amazon Prime day. I think you can wait if you plan to buy. In the US it costs only 650-700 bucks, so the Indian price may reduce in a while.

I would recommend the EF to EF-M mount adapter along with the Canon 50mm F1.8 STM lens, or even the EF-M 22mm F2 lens if you prefer the compact form factor (no adapter business). They do make a significant quality difference in portrait photography and further improve the sharpness of the camera. I would add some sample clicks in the future with my Nifty Fifty lens.

The supplied carry bag is too big, hence I bought the Amazon Basics Carry bag for Compact Cameras, and that fits it well (even some of the other mirrorless cameras too). The m50 is now in a really compact package and I can take it along easily in my backpack most of the time.

Update: May 2019

1. Since now this is available at below 50k, with offers and discounts it can be owned at 45k, this is a steal in my honest opinion.
2. Added sample photos!!! Particularly from the popular 50mm f1.8 lens, used with an adaptor.

Update: September 2019

1. I am enjoying the camera more and more, the camera has just the right amount of controls for a beginner.
2. I came to know about Viltrox Speed Booster for M50. Adding a speed booster is an awesome way to make the camera much more capable. Planning to buy it, but would probably directly get it from US or China.

Update: December 2020

1. Sigma lenses have made this EOS-M series cameras way more complete and worth than ever.
2. I strongly recommend the ""16mm F1.4 Sigma"" for Vlogging, ""30mm F1.4 Sigma"" or ""32mm F1.4 Canon"" for Street and Portraits.
3. But, the ""56mm F1.4 Sigma"", I would settle with the ""50mm F.18 Canon"" for the value it offers.

Moreover, there is an update to the original Canon M50 with a Mark ii, with an almost identical feature set.
I don't know why Canon calls it mark ii.

Also, if you plan on serious content creation and want the best quality, in the long run, I would recommend the Canon EOS RP (Body only) with Canon EF 17-40mm and 50mm (Nifty-fifty)"

73,3.6 out of 5,"At this price i'd say it's a good Flash. I've been using it for a couple of photo sessions & here my opinion:

⍟It's a totally Manual flash, so you have to manually adjust the power & the flash exposure compensation.

⍟Build quality was pretty average, not something to brag about but it works & gets the job done.

⍟It comes with a carry bag & a mini stand. And it's Made in China.

⍟The Flash is very powerful with a Guide Number of 65 very useful for all kinds of scenarios.

⍟Works with most Nikon & Canon DSLRs. Haven't tried it with other brands but it should work fine.

⍟It requires 4 AA Batteries, i could get up to 200 shots at full power using 2550MAh Eneloop Pro from Panasonic. Recycle time was kinda slow but mostly under 3 seconds.

⍟It can also be use in Optical Slave Mode that means you can trigger it using your camera pop-up or built-in flash. Very useful for a single Off-Camera Flash setup.

⍟At low power 128/64 it gives that vignette effects which was kinda odd cause I've never seen that in a flash.

⍟It doesn't have an Auto-Focus assist beam.

Overall it's a good buy, it might not be the best but at this price i'll take it.

Hope this helps."

77,4.4 out of 5,"Writing a review after 3 months of usage. Firstly, this is not a ""dslr"". It's point and shoot camera. I bought it for bird/wildlife photography. And I must recommend this camera if you want to capture birds or insects or even butterflies. Zoom feature is simply superb and can capture distant objects at ease. Image stabilization is good within 65x zoom limit. If you want to go beyond that, I suggest buying tripod or gorilla pods. Learning the various modes is so easy and camera adjusts most of the things for you like there is auto for every setting. Finally, if you love birds and tiny objects, this camera by canon is my first suggestion. I am satisfied with its performance in this price range. The only drawback is battery life. I felt charging it quite frequently. But the rest is perfect."

Laptop holder is big enough for a normal size laptop. There is some protection layer running throughout the bag edges so that if you keep the bag down the contents inside won't hit the surface directly.

Only con if any is that if you open the bag vertically the camera will fall off since there is no strap to hold the camera. So always have to be careful to place its horizontal.

Not sure about waterproof nature of the bag ."

105,4.9 out of 5," Camera is amazing.
Looks very beautiful.
A full frame camera in such a small size!!
Delivery was safe and quick. No damage to the camera packaging at all, and all free items were safe and present.
You get a camera bag, an external charger and a memory card free with your purchase!
One problem : The camera does heat up a little bit on prolong usage!
It even has high temperature related shutdown settings, which means it's supposed to get too hot to operate!
Don't know how will it perform during delhi summers haha.
Performance is amazing, autofocus is very very accurate and quick!"

Laptop holder is big enough for a normal size laptop. There is some protection layer running throughout the bag edges so that if you keep the bag down the contents inside won't hit the surface directly.

Only con if any is that if you open the bag vertically the camera will fall off since there is no strap to hold the camera. So always have to be careful to place its horizontal.

139,4.5 out of 5,"I've had an X-T3 for a couple of years, and before that had an X100F. The latter was my favorite camera ever, but I felt too limited by the fixed lens. The X-E4 - which I bought as a second camera - is pretty close to that X100 experience: it's smaller and lighter than the X-T3, but has the same sensor and image quality. Some people may not like the lack of buttons and dials on the device; if you spend a lot of time fiddling with your camera, then this might not be for you. I don't fiddle much: I generally shoot in aperture priority, and make very few changes when I'm shooting.

One thing to bear in mind is that with the small size of this camera, you might not find it easy to use with a large lens. I find this is great for the smaller prime lenses - the f2 and f2.8 ""Fujicrons"" - but it's unbalanced with a larger lens, like the 16-80mm zoom. The 18-55mm zoom lens is okay, but anything larger means you might struggle against the camera. And, if you plan to use larger, heavier lenses, you probably want to get the additional grip.

All in all, this may become my favorite camera ever, superseding the X100F. With the new 27mm lens, available as the ""kit"" lens with this camera, it is pocketable, and it's almost as small and light as the X100 series."

155,4.4 out of 5,"The XT-200 is typically a successor of Fujifilm’s entry-level mirrorless camera XT-100 which was launched more than a year ago and its pricing sits just below the mid-ranger XT-30. Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.

1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.

2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it’s hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.

3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There’s a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.

4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there’s a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.

5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there’s a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.

6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.

7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.

8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.

Cons:

- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don’t feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.

- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.

- At such a high price point Fujifilm should’ve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.

In case you’ve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.

It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to mail me for any queries and follow me for more such informative reviews."

1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.

2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it’s hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.

3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There’s a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.

4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there’s a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.

5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there’s a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.

6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.

7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.

8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.

Cons:

- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don’t feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.

- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.

- At such a high price point Fujifilm should’ve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.

In case you’ve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.

P.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard-earned money gets its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to mail me for any queries and follow me for more such informative reviews."

Laptop holder is big enough for a normal size laptop. There is some protection layer running throughout the bag edges so that if you keep the bag down the contents inside won't hit the surface directly.

Only con if any is that if you open the bag vertically the camera will fall off since there is no strap to hold the camera. So always have to be careful to place its horizontal.

183,1 out of 5," After installing this adapter, when u press the picture clicking button half, it performs 2 steps. It swipes the entire range of focus of ur lens and then starts to focus itself on the spot u focused upon.
Hence the focusing is very slow. Also during video, it does not autofocus itself on an object by touching on the screen as u see in a directly attached lens. U have to first click on the spot on the screen where u want to focus and then press the picture button half to start focusing on ur object. So in all of this, the time of focusing is soooo long that u wud find better to rotate the focus ring with ur hand manually and complete ur shoot.
Also out of 3 attempts, 1st time it may not focus clear on the object, even thr 2nd time it's also no guarantee. The 3rd time when clicked, when the captured picture is observed closely zoomed in, u will find that the focusing is not done sharp (I am using a F1.8 50mm lens) A manually done focusing is way better, quicker and sharper than using this autofocusing adapter.
In other words, it is a manual focus adapter itself while having autofocus. U have to manually keep touching focus points on ur screen and keep pressing the picture button half every time to change ur focus on the object. The only so called advantage u can call is that u don’t have to fiddle with ur focus ring. But that will not fulfill my need. Hence returning"

1. The description says that it includes 2 microfiber cloths, however neither of them is actually microfiber. The thicker one cleans decently, but the other one is made of such low quality material that I had to dispose it the same day.

2. The description says ""Rubber blower very powerful"", and I can't help but laugh at that line. The blower is so weak that it can manage to displace a particle of dust only about 3 cm from its original place. Absolute waste, and another item I had to trash the same day.

3. The brush is alright at best, but the strands are way to soft and flexible to effectively clean dirt and dust from under the keyboard and in the speakers. I feel you require at least a slightly more firm brush to do the job effectively.

Overall, I strongly suggest to NOT BUY this cleaning kit, unless you are alright with a substandard kit!"

202,4.7 out of 5,"An entirely capable Mirrorless camera from Sony who presented this camera as an 'Entry Level' Full Frame camera. It gives you features which most professional DSLR's cannot give, all for a body MRP of below 2 lakhs. My review about every segment of this camera:

1- Body: Sony claims that the body is Magnesium Alloy which is only dust proof and splash proof, so you might wanna reconsider if you are going to be shooting in heavy rain or very unlikely conditions, which most of us won't be. The buttons on the back feels nice and clicky, with Sony following the same button layout as in the Sony A7R3, which was praised by photographers a lot.

2- Performance and AF: It does a whopping 10 frame per second shooting with both Mechanical and electronic shutter, and has the same Autofocus system in the Sony A9, which is a 3 lakh INR camera! This is insane! The interesting part is, the AF points cover about 93% of the screen, so it is a great feature to have while recording video. It also has the legendary Eye-AF, which was introduced in the A7R3, and works like a charm. One thing though, is that you can't use Eye-AF while recording video, it is applicable only for photography.

3- Photography and Video Features: It has a 24MP Backlit CMOS sensor, which means that it should have better low light performance since it is backlit. And yes, it does! The low light performance even outruns the A7R3, and this camera. is a beast in low light! Taking portraits should be easier since it has the Eye AF, and it is very much ideal for photography of fast moving subjects. The Autofocus tracking is absolutely wonderful, and if you're using native Sony lenses, then you shouldn't have any problems at all. Another advantage is the crop mode in this camera, which only utilises the APS-C size of the sensor. You can still attach your crop sensor lenses and still get awesome stills and video without any Vignetting.
The movie recording capabilities of this camera blows most of the pro-DSLR's out of the water. 4K 30fps, and 1080p upto 120fps. And the quality of the footage looks much more improvised when comparing it to older models like the A6300. You get all the Professional Picture Profiles in Video as well!

4- Battery Life: Since Sony is using the new Z-series batteries for this camera, battery life is significantly improved. I could shoot for a whole day(both clips and stills) and still had 30% battery at the end of the day. It's good to have one more battery though.

5. Who is it for: Well, for the features it offers, it definitely is a Pro camera. But at this price point, it can be used by anyone who wants a Full Frame Camera to start off! It is absolutely a Bang for the Buck camera(if only more) and it is a pleasure carrying it around and shooting with it! If you are a landscape photographer and wants more Megapixels than 24MP for cropping in, then I would suggest the A7R3 or even the A7R2! The A7R2 is still a very capable camera with similar features, but terrible battery life and average AF capability. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE SONY A73 TO ABSOLUTELY ANYONE WHO HAS AN INTEREST AND THE BUDGET TO BUY THIS CAMERA!

ENJOY THE CAMERA! YOU ARE GONNA BUY YOURSELF A BEAST!"

The Autofocus tracking is absolutely wonderful, and if you're using native Sony lenses, then you shouldn't have any problems at all. Another advantage is the crop mode in this camera, which only utilises the APS-C size of the sensor. You can still attach your crop sensor lenses and still get awesome stills and video without any Vignetting.
The movie recording capabilities of this camera blows most of the pro-DSLR's out of the water. 4K 30fps, and 1080p upto 120fps. And the quality of the footage looks much more improvised when comparing it to older models like the A6300. You get all the Professional Picture Profiles in Video as well!

4- Battery Life: Since Sony is using the new Z-series batteries for this camera, battery life is significantly improved. I could shoot for a whole day(both clips and stills) and still had 30% battery at the end of the day. It's good to have one more battery though.

5. Who is it for: Well, for the features it offers, it definitely is a Pro camera. But at this price point, it can be used by anyone who wants a Full Frame Camera to start off! It is absolutely a Bang for the Buck camera(if only more) and it is a pleasure carrying it around and shooting with it! If you are a landscape photographer and wants more Megapixels than 24MP for cropping in, then I would suggest the A7R3 or even the A7R2! The A7R2 is still a very capable camera with similar features, but terrible battery life and average AF capability. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE SONY A73 TO ABSOLUTELY ANYONE WHO HAS AN INTEREST AND THE BUDGET TO BUY THIS CAMERA!

ENJOY THE CAMERA! YOU ARE GONNA BUY YOURSELF A BEAST!"
204,5 out of 5,"An entirely capable Mirrorless camera from Sony who presented this camera as an 'Entry Level' Full Frame camera. It gives you features which most professional DSLR's cannot give, all for a body MRP of below 2 lakhs. My review about every segment of this camera:

1- Body: Sony claims that the body is Magnesium Alloy which is only dust proof and splash proof, so you might wanna reconsider if you are going to be shooting in heavy rain or very unlikely conditions, which most of us won't be. The buttons on the back feels nice and clicky, with Sony following the same button layout as in the Sony A7R3, which was praised by photographers a lot.

2- Performance and AF: It does a whopping 10 frame per second shooting with both Mechanical and electronic shutter, and has the same Autofocus system in the Sony A9, which is a 3 lakh INR camera! This is insane! The interesting part is, the AF points cover about 93% of the screen, so it is a great feature to have while recording video. It also has the legendary Eye-AF, which was introduced in the A7R3, and works like a charm. One thing though, is that you can't use Eye-AF while recording video, it is applicable only for photography.

3- Photography and Video Features: It has a 24MP Backlit CMOS sensor, which means that it should have better low light performance since it is backlit. And yes, it does! The low light performance even outruns the A7R3, and this camera. is a beast in low light!

206,5 out of 5,"I'm a semi-professional photographer and I always jump on the chance to review cameras because I love them. This one is such a unique product that I'm really excited about it. My review will mainly be a comparison of whether or not you should get this camera (the Sony ZV-1) as opposed to a DSLR or even smart phone.

*DO NOT get this camera if your main interest is still photographs. If you want still photographs then the DSLR is what you want. This camera has the added perk of taking photos, but the main focus of this is video content sharing.

*The highlight of this camera is the ease of use. You really don't need to know technical things like which aperture to choose, which ISO or shutter speed, it does everything for you. It has auto focus (which is much better than on DSLRs) and the flip screen makes it easy to monitor yourself while you're recording.

*The size of this makes it far superior to a DSLR. This thing is *tiny* and so lightweight. If you get the accessory kit with the wireless grip/tripod, you are good to go. This is especially good if you vlog while walking or need to be active when speaking to the camera.

*Has slow-mo capability, time-lapse, bluetooth and wifi.

*Benefits over just a regular 'ol smartphone: The image sensor on this is much bigger and better. With image sensors, the adage is ""the bigger the better"" which is why DSLR cameras have such an advantage (but they're also too big to lug around) This makes your image quality much higher. The microphone on this is also way better too. (With the DSLR, you would need to buy a separate mic.) You are free to buy a separate mic with this camera as well but the mic that it comes with is pretty good right out of the box.

*Things that could be improved: The software it comes with is rather limited. Especially for editing videos, though on the plus side, you may not need to do too much editing if you are the type that just does your vlogging in one continuous take.

*The lenses are built in/ not interchangeable. This is good in that you have everything you need at all times, but bad if you scratched/cracked your lens you would need to buy a whole new camera.

*There's no flash - this shouldn't be an issue for vloggers though. Just wanted to mention in case someone was still thinking of getting this solely for still photography.

*The battery life was middling. It wasn't great but I've seen other cameras perform worse. If you feel like you're going to be having long sessions, I would consider getting a second battery just in case.

Overall, I think this is a great and versatile camera for those who vlog or create video content. The price is higher so you can buy a DSLR at this price point, however if you're not into technical things or would rather something more user friendly then this is definitely the route to take."

212,4.8 out of 5,"Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets see

PROS
1. Its easy to use
2. Decent battery backup
3. Live mode operation is not lagging.

CONS
1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.
2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.
3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.
4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.
5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk
6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject
7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.
I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.
In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.

I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.
Its not worth for money"

224,3.9 out of 5,"The XT-200 is typically a successor of Fujifilm’s entry-level mirrorless camera XT-100 which was launched more than a year ago and its pricing sits just below the mid-ranger XT-30. Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.

1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.

2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it’s hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.

3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There’s a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.

4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there’s a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.

5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there’s a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.

6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.

7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.

8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.

Cons:

- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don’t feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.

- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.

- At such a high price point Fujifilm should’ve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.

In case you’ve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.

P.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard-earned money gets its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to mail me for any queries and follow me for more such informative reviews."

226,3.9 out of 5,"The XT-200 is typically a successor of Fujifilm’s entry-level mirrorless camera XT-100 which was launched more than a year ago and its pricing sits just below the mid-ranger XT-30. Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.

1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.

2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it’s hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.

3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There’s a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.

4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there’s a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.

5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there’s a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.

6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.

7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.

8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.

Cons:

- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don’t feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.

228,3.2 out of 5,"I had been looking for a good camera for under Rs 1 lakh for sometime when Fujifilm launched this camera last year and it immediately became a hot favourite of several camera review forums/channels. From a value for money perspective, I think this camera has no competition in the market if you try to find a feature to feature match for this price. From a cost to performance perspective it gets even better. This is a very capable camera. In a few days that I have spent with it, I have found myself pleasantly surprised multiple times by the quality of images that it produces and I am not even talking about the quality of raw files here. I know that relying on SOOC JPEGs may not be a feasible option for a lot of people. However I think if you are so inclined, this is the camera that fits the bill. This is a fairly advanced camera and it is heavily customizable. And although it is very easy to get your photos out of it and into a smartphone, you can't expect the workflow to be the same as a smartphone camera. But then again, the image quality you get is light years ahead of what the best smartphone cameras can do. I bought it without the kit lens and paired it with the cheap xc35mm f2 prime and so far I'm loving it."

250,3.1 out of 5,"I've had an X-T3 for a couple of years, and before that had an X100F. The latter was my favorite camera ever, but I felt too limited by the fixed lens. The X-E4 - which I bought as a second camera - is pretty close to that X100 experience: it's smaller and lighter than the X-T3, but has the same sensor and image quality. Some people may not like the lack of buttons and dials on the device; if you spend a lot of time fiddling with your camera, then this might not be for you. I don't fiddle much: I generally shoot in aperture priority, and make very few changes when I'm shooting.

One thing to bear in mind is that with the small size of this camera, you might not find it easy to use with a large lens. I find this is great for the smaller prime lenses - the f2 and f2.8 ""Fujicrons"" - but it's unbalanced with a larger lens, like the 16-80mm zoom. The 18-55mm zoom lens is okay, but anything larger means you might struggle against the camera. And, if you plan to use larger, heavier lenses, you probably want to get the additional grip.

All in all, this may become my favorite camera ever, superseding the X100F. With the new 27mm lens, available as the ""kit"" lens with this camera, it is pocketable, and it's almost as small and light as the X100 series."

4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there’s a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.

5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there’s a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.

6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.

7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.

8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.

Cons:

- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don’t feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.

- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.

- At such a high price point Fujifilm should’ve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.

In case you’ve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.

265,4.5 out of 5,"The XT-200 is typically a successor of Fujifilm’s entry-level mirrorless camera XT-100 which was launched more than a year ago and its pricing sits just below the mid-ranger XT-30. Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.

1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.

🙇🏻‍♂️ | FINAL THOUGHTS:
==================
I think it's the best budget camera u can get also the quality of the photos is very top-notch. Overall it is very good to go camera without any second thoughts. Existing a few cons which I think Fujifilm can improve just with the software updates. Also, please go and get an XC 35mm f2 Prime lense it's a day-night difference in terms of optical quality from the kit lens. Trust me. Fujifilm Lens is a bit over the budget but they have the best lenses with the best optical quality nothing can match their lenses.

💆🏻‍♂️ | PRO TIPS:
• Get a UV filter to protect your lens from dust and scratches and also it protects your camera sensor from harmful UV lights.
• Always change the lens in a clean environment if your r traveling and outside use your car inside to change it as micro dust particles on your sensor can give dark spots in your photos.
• Buy a squeeze air blower to remove dust if it gets to your sensor.
• Remove the battery when you are not using the camera for a longer time period.

282,3.7 out of 5,"I got this camera after seeing rave reviews in YouTube. However, this review will focus on the shortcomings only. I discovered after 10 days of use.
1. Poor battery life : does not last even 3 hours of use. However, this is compensated by the extra battery provided. But the way battery compartment is designed does no good to the purpose. you need to unscrew from mount to change The battery. So you will need to break your schedule in case u are shooting something continuous.
2. Error Error - the dreaded E:62:10 error appeared in my camera after few days of use. Although I did not face any difficulty in shooting. It did make my experience bitter. Could not resolve though the solutions available on internet. The usual switch on of. Change battery etc does not work and the error message is a part of the display now.
3. Mic : even tough the mic is a strong one. It does not do well to reduce background noise.
4. Charging time : 150 mins. This really restricts ur ability to shoot and u need to plan ahead if you are a serious vlogger.
5. Not weather proof. : the manual says it is not weather proof and small amounts of water may damage the internal circuits. I mean why? It restricts your ability to take outdoor shoot and a vlogger would not take this.

Apart from the above. The camera delivers what it promises in the review videos.

Update :
My lens assembly was faulty. Thankfully Sony service centre was open and as directed by the Sony representative, I gave the camera for repair. It took 14 days to get the part from abroad and complete the repairs. Now, the camera is working fine. No issues as such.
Update 2: Please go through the settings and understand each setting before shooting. There are a lot of helpful YouTube videos on this camera.
Update 3 : The camera worked fine for 2 days after repairs. As of now it is still in the repair shop. 2 months after purchase the camera is 28 days.(and counting) in repair shop. Even after 2 trips of repair shop the error does not go away. Now it is a permanent display in my camera.
Update 4: Sony had finally replaced the camera with a new one. Will update if there are issues in the new one. From mid September to mid December the camera was in the repair centre for at least 50 days before it was finally replaced."

It is easily fittable on lens. You can also fit extra lens guard on front of them and lens cover either one or both .

However I am using lens guard directly on lens then lens hood then lens cover.

By this way iy took time for me to screw up lens hood on camera lens.
And little shadow of lens good can seen on picture corners at 25mm focus"

By this way iy took time for me to screw up lens hood on camera lens.

298,4 out of 5,Beware of these sellers. They'll show you something different in title and product description and you'll get something different. The title of this product says that the size of the light is 18 inches but I got 10 inches delivered to me. I usually don't write bad reviews to the new sellers but this seller is betraying your trust. At lease you should be honest with your customers. I was amazed to see that someone is selling 18 inches ring light so cheap. I thought give it a try might be worth it. The product is worth the price but the only thing that I'm furious at is the incorrect details at every step.

308,3.6 out of 5,"Writing a review after 3 months of usage. Firstly, this is not a ""dslr"". It's point and shoot camera. I bought it for bird/wildlife photography. And I must recommend this camera if you want to capture birds or insects or even butterflies. Zoom feature is simply superb and can capture distant objects at ease. Image stabilization is good within 65x zoom limit. If you want to go beyond that, I suggest buying tripod or gorilla pods. Learning the various modes is so easy and camera adjusts most of the things for you like there is auto for every setting. Finally, if you love birds and tiny objects, this camera by canon is my first suggestion. I am satisfied with its performance in this price range. The only drawback is battery life. I felt charging it quite frequently. But the rest is perfect."

336,4.3 out of 5,"This item is plastic and in image it looks like soft material but not and hard plastic but good quality. The black item which you insert in to flash drive is not that much of good quality. But overall product is OK. And package and delivery was upto the mark and even one day before.

But on 700D & 1200 D flash drive has two arms with small button underneath (see images attached) to recognize that hot shoe flash is inserted. So, when you insert this into drive it recognize like a hot shoe flash is inserted, in fact not. So as others suggested you have to leave some space and should not insert completely inside. (This is not mentioned by company anywhere) So that it will not press them down and they will not press the the buttons underneath those, hence camera wont recognize that something is inserted.

But keep in mind that there is a chance that they may fall from drive and there is a thin line between stop (not to recognize) and insert more inside (it may recognize) which MAY cause damage to internal flash drive (Experts can confirm this). Product wise I am satisfied but with same reason I am returning to go for better option."

🙅🏻‍♂️ | CONS :
—————
• Flash doesn’t pop out of the body automatically when flash mode is on 😅.
• It doesn’t charge the battery at the same time while using the camera. (Which I hope in future updates will bring this functionality please Fujifilm listen to this one)
• No functionality of using the camera directly from the Charging port.
• Battery capacity should be at least 2500 mah as compared to 1200 mah for this I feel is very less.
• One video recording session is limited to 15mins in 4k and 1080p 30 mins which I believe should be removed. (Again Fujifilm please remove this limitation which can be done on the software end itself)
• 4K quality need to improve hopefully future updates will improve this.
• No fast charging 😩.

🙇🏻‍♂️ | FINAL THOUGHTS:
==================
I think it's the best budget camera u can get also the quality of the photos is very top-notch. Overall it is very good to go camera without any second thoughts. Existing a few cons which I think Fujifilm can improve just with the software updates. Also, please go and get an XC 35mm f2 Prime lense it's a day-night difference in terms of optical quality from the kit lens. Trust me. Fujifilm Lens is a bit over the budget but they have the best lenses with the best optical quality nothing can match their lenses.

💆🏻‍♂️ | PRO TIPS:
• Get a UV filter to protect your lens from dust and scratches and also it protects your camera sensor from harmful UV lights.
• Always change the lens in a clean environment if your r traveling and outside use your car inside to change it as micro dust particles on your sensor can give dark spots in your photos.
• Buy a squeeze air blower to remove dust if it gets to your sensor.
• Remove the battery when you are not using the camera for a longer time period.

🙅🏻‍♂️ | CONS :
—————
• Flash doesn’t pop out of the body automatically when flash mode is on 😅.
• It doesn’t charge the battery at the same time while using the camera. (Which I hope in future updates will bring this functionality please Fujifilm listen to this one)
• No functionality of using the camera directly from the Charging port.
• Battery capacity should be at least 2500 mah as compared to 1200 mah for this I feel is very less.
• One video recording session is limited to 15mins in 4k and 1080p 30 mins which I believe should be removed. (Again Fujifilm please remove this limitation which can be done on the software end itself)
• 4K quality need to improve hopefully future updates will improve this.
• No fast charging 😩.

🙇🏻‍♂️ | FINAL THOUGHTS:
==================
I think it's the best budget camera u can get also the quality of the photos is very top-notch. Overall it is very good to go camera without any second thoughts. Existing a few cons which I think Fujifilm can improve just with the software updates. Also, please go and get an XC 35mm f2 Prime lense it's a day-night difference in terms of optical quality from the kit lens. Trust me. Fujifilm Lens is a bit over the budget but they have the best lenses with the best optical quality nothing can match their lenses.

💆🏻‍♂️ | PRO TIPS:
• Get a UV filter to protect your lens from dust and scratches and also it protects your camera sensor from harmful UV lights.
• Always change the lens in a clean environment if your r traveling and outside use your car inside to change it as micro dust particles on your sensor can give dark spots in your photos.
• Buy a squeeze air blower to remove dust if it gets to your sensor.
• Remove the battery when you are not using the camera for a longer time period.

🐲 | ULTRA PRO TIP:
••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Get Camera sensor Cleaning swaps if your sensor is affected by smug or dust particles that are hard to remove by squeeze an air blower."

358,3.9 out of 5,Good camera with great picture quality for the size.You get a better picture than iphone 11 but not better than a7 111 but somewhere just below a6400 and a6600 with kit lens.Advantages are tremendous unless you are a professional photographer.If you don't require zoom rx 100 mV would be slightly better for low light.In A nutshell it is for an everyday user who wants a all rounder carry around camera but needs a near dslr quality but better zoom and clarity than smartphone.If your requirements fit the above category you can buy it without second thought.
