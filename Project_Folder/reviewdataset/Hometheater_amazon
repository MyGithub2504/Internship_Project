Pioneer SBX-101 Wireless Sounbar Black with sub woofer https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07C36RD6H/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_S1Z4EbSXZ2W8F

before I write something about the quality and value for money of this product, i would be glad if someone can tell me who the makers of this product is. I’m certain that even Samsung (Parent company) won’t let anyOne even see a product Like this.

1. There is nowhere in harman, jbl or infinity websites this model is listed ( india and outside).
2. The url provided in the small leaflet or I should say a “manual” to register your product for warranty, is not genuine and there is no website.
3. This product can only be replaced, no returns. :)

Sound quality: the worst ever high freq response and the speaker makes a tremblIng noise at highs and you can note that even in low volume.
2k desktop 2.1 would sound better than this.

Subwoofer: The 4 -5 inch paper Cone backfiring sub, has a bad finishing Of the novopan sheet at the rear - reminds me about A best local Bookshelf speaker assembler in town.
This sub is better as a stand-alone piece, as the midrange and sub Doesn’t blend well - In short the crossover isn’t working at all.

Do some homework before you shell out even single penny!
You can go for boat, or any brands that are worth (sound, quality n support) for the price and at least listed in their websites."

16,3.9 out of 5,"Today 25th Oct 2020, I received my product. One week prior delivery than given date. Fast delivery. Connected to IPhone 6, the Aux, Bluetooth and usb port. Worked perfectly as mentioned. Bluetooth volume is a little higher than Aux volume. It is almost parallel to Panasonic ht 21. Bass enclosure is sturdy and satellite speakers are light. Sound quality is good and clear. Bass is nice and my room 12x20ft room is booming like speaker enclosure. For some english songs I have to reduce bass in my player app for appropriate good bass. So far everything goes well as anticipated. I can’t understand why such a nice product Akai has very little response in market. Perhaps Indians are more incline to Philips, Sony and Panasonic. In audio systems Akai is identical to Sony and I am using Akai music systems since 1981 when my father bought it for me"

34,3.9 out of 5,"Sound quality is very bad and the sub starts cracking at volume 10 !! May be most of the reviews of this product are framed .. The subwoofer is a small 4 inch driver wih no base output, only low frequency noise.... I checked the product website and looks it to be a bogus one..

Request the potential buyers to stay away from this and look for different options. Unfortunately I bought this and there is no return policy ..

Definitely this is not a 80 watt amplifier ..."

46,3.4 out of 5,"When the package arrived ,honestly I was disappointed with the sound.I conected with blue tooth option for my smart LED TV it was like just to hear I had to put ON the full volume & I was considering a return.Then I thought about all the reviews here and on youtube,I decided to go with another shot and buy a RCA to 3.5 mm and after the connection I realized the true potential of the BEAST (I mean it). For all who listening it on bluetooth you are not even getting half the sound.Try on a RCA-3.5MM you will see the difference.Doesn't even flutter on Full volume.Comming back to the sound quality it's simple awesome words can never define sound BUT you can't go wrong with this product."

50,4.2 out of 5,"I got this 2.1 in big billion day sale for rs 1299/- , the speaker are loud enough for your indoor use, the base is not suprb but its is good as compared to its price. It is not possible to get a better deal than this at this price range. Over all the sound quality is good but a little distortion take place while playing musics from a high output source such as laptop on full volume.
The delivery was very late, it took about more than a week , there was no amazon packaging on the box it was just the box of f&d (same available in market) but the contents was in good condition and intact so no complains.
My verdict- go for it if u have a budget near about 1500rs."

58,3.8 out of 5,"Pros:
1. Looks attractive and does not eat to much space.
2. Ideal for a small room
3. Satellite speaks are decent
4. Remote is very nice and has a good response.
5. Connecting on pc/FM/Bluetooth/aux is super easy and does not even require to connect to manual.
6. Make sure when connecting to pc or any device via wire, press the Aux button in remote

Cons:
1. Sub woofer is too small and does not contribute well to your sound experience.
2. Woofer effect is almost not present or it's not powerful enough to give you any thump as it should. Don't expect this to give you that thump, it will not.
3. I find the cables to short to place the satellite speakers well.
4. There is distortion in sound, if you keep Bass even to half of its capacity and then everything get shaky.

Overall do not buy this and but FD has a good speakers in upper range. So, add few buck to your shopping and go for top range.

FD is good with the hardware and I would still recommend FD in top range, as my previous speakers from FD survived more than 5 years and never gave a problem and I had a good sound experience with it.

Well that said, this product is still ideal for someone listening to songs that would not involve loud thumps from the bass and just want to enjoy Bluetooth connectivity/FM/USB in small space with very little to spend."

Worked perfectly as mentioned. Bluetooth volume is a little higher than Aux volume. It is almost parallel to Panasonic ht 21. Bass enclosure is sturdy and satellite speakers are light. Sound quality is good and clear. Bass is nice and my room 12x20ft room is booming like speaker enclosure. For some english songs I have to reduce bass in my player app for appropriate good bass. So far everything goes well as anticipated. I can’t understand why such a nice product Akai has very little response in market. Perhaps Indians are more incline to Philips, Sony and Panasonic. In audio systems Akai is identical to Sony and I am using Akai music systems since 1981 when my father bought it for me"

Sound is good as per the price consideration, but looks are glossy & simple with little soothing light effects which look beautiful when room lights are off.
For now, all things - packing, delivery, service, & quality, all seems to be fine & hope so it lasts long✅"

Looks are decent, with the woofer on the downside of wooden box , as seen in F&D home theater. Satellites have silver woofers, which together with the centre woofer deliver a relatively good sound , which is enough for a small 2 bhk flat where I live .
All functions are working properly, making it a perfect buy.

142,5 out of 5,"I hope you have glanced through many other reviews' already, so i would like to scribble some points which i didnt find in other reviews'.
First of all dimensions
Sub: length 17cm width 26cm height 27.5cm
Sat : length 10cm width 7.5cm height 16 cm
Pros'
1. The sound is of good quality with appreciable amount of bass for the small sized unit.
2. Fm is good though i tried in a region with very less reception of the same.
3. Bass adjustment switch.
4. Pretty good remote which can be easily operated unlike the cheap ones which need to pointed exactly towards the reception area.
5. Bluetooth is working fine and pairs easily with average range...like within the room or adjacent one max.
6. A cable for connecting dth or tv or the like....is provided....which has av sockets at one end and the 3.5 mm stereo jack at the other end for connection to other devices like the mentioned.
7. A wire runs out from the side which acts as fm antenna and could be extended in case you need to place atenna outside.
8. Display is bright and readable which provides necessary info like usb or bt or fm and volume plus it indicates power or standby.
Cons.
1. The power switch is on the side panel of sub. In addition you can turn it off in remote controller which is easy, but doing so doesn't cut the power to the main board since it gets heated and also it powers the usb drive that you have plugged in, which turns it hot.
2. The initial volume level, i.e. , level 1 itself is very loud which turns to be a great drawback when you dont want to disturb others.
3. The device doesn't have a memory to store settings, so once you turn off the power plug, and you turn it on next time it starts with a very high volume say level 12 or so. However it remains in the same mode...i.e. ...bt or usb or so.... that you have last used it before power off.

Altogether it is a recommended product. The packing is the same company packing just cling wrapped. The product seems to be original with all stickers and warranty card and all. The product is also not much heavy. The sub box is made of wood.
Thank you."

Request the potential buyers to stay away from this and look for different options. Unfortunately I bought this and there is no return policy ..

Definitely this is not a 80 watt amplifier ..."

172,4.1 out of 5,"Aiming for a Made in India product to complete my home theatre system and aware that this spectrum is dominated by foreign brands, I hit up on this brand on Amazon last week. Also given my budget constraints, I admit to have ordered this almost unknown Indian brand with a lot of skepticism.

I was in for a surprise when I laid my hands, eyes and ears on DHWANI DJ 40W Bluetooth Tower Home Theater System which arrived this morning. Prompt delivery by Amazon and good packaging too..

Here is what I loved about Tronica’s DHWANI:

The stylish and sleek wooden cabinet
Good built quality given the price
Great bluetooth reception and wireless experience
USB port, SD card reader, Aux port and great FM reception
Good and thumping bass, as per the subwoofer specifications
Perfect for medium sized room with good remote range
Crystal clear vocal experience both on highs and lows

I did try few other brands at this price including some slightly pricier ones and some of them have been harsh on the ears to be honest. This wonderful tower is a great buy at this steal away price.

Try this out if you also believe in Vocal for Local like me and trust me, you won’t be disappointed."

You can not connect your smart tv with this sound system. you have to connect many cables to connect it with the smart tv even after connection, you can not hear online content like netflix or others sound in this sony 5.1 sound system. Even amazon customer executive is not helpful to solve your query. when i received the system on second day itself, i came to know that the system is not supportive to my samsung smart tv and when i call the executive for return the product. He told that this product can not be returned but on amazon business site, it is showing returnable. This product is like a showpiece to me. I suggest not to go for this product as it is not having any latest features, even sony installation person is saying that this is waste of money and you should go for higher model which Rs.22,000.

Pros
1) Bass quality is good.
2) Finishing is premium.
3) similar quality sound bar in branded category will cost you more.

Cons
1) Remote build quality is sub standard. Not connecting at times with device.
2) Hd channels & Amazon prime videos r supporting HDMI mode in PCM. Actually Dolby digital is not Supported by HDMI mode which is biggest pain point. Other Modes r fine like AUX and bluetooth.
3) HDMI cable is not provided along device. U have to purchase it.

If u have bigger budget(approx rs10k) go for philips HTL 2163 B/12"

Very average product, very low output, very low sound, poor tweeters, low bass, simple very flat sound which will not give feeling of satisfaction combined with a very low volume. I had submitted a detailed review which Amazon ecommerce team have removed and they are not placing it back even after multiple follow ups. Hope this one will also be removed. No immersive sound. Felt cheated when I first listened to it. Volume was so low that what good a tweeter or woofer would do when enough sound is not there. Volume button dies where one wants it to start. Burn out period is a myth. Think for a while. Does any other brand talks about any such thing. Answer is NO. It's just a flat desi DHOLL with flat output which 90% people will not like. Felt like listening to songs while seated in a state transport bus. Obage don't either have any outlet where you can listen these first. Don't buy anything on anybody's recommendation before actually testing the system for real and spending your hard earned money. And this system is heavy just bcoz of heaviness of wooden material.... It's not like other quality aspects are heavy or worth discussion. It is heavy to be just heavy by weight only... nothing which could guarantee an immersive sound. Very average product. Not for youngsters or low bass lovers even... forget those who love actual bass. Just suitable for bhajans and old low melodies when you sit in front of the speakers....Feels sturdy on built only, rest is a myth as you buy a music system for listening and not for your antique showcase... Test any system somewhere before purchasing it as you may suffer and regret with ht 144 kind of system. Obage people correctly mention it as not for loud listeners...Volume output will never satisfy a heartful listener one who wants to enjoy the song. My 32 inch old toshiba tv speakees have a loud output than this. You tube hype seems not be genuine. Strongly hope this review will get removed soon as was done with my previous detailed review."

Sound is nice & powerful & clear (Don't expect more explanation I'm not a sound engineer)... And I review it after months of use & it hadn't upset me...

I mean it's so good that you can forgive them for misspelling the word ""Speaker"" & also forgive their poor grammar... If you didn't understand what I mean don't worry watch the pics... But anyways we are buying speakers & not english novels so it's all well...

Sound quality is good and clear. Bass is nice and my room 12x20ft room is booming like speaker enclosure. For some english songs I have to reduce bass in my player app for appropriate good bass. So far everything goes well as anticipated. I can’t understand why such a nice product Akai has very little response in market. Perhaps Indians are more incline to Philips, Sony and Panasonic. In audio systems Akai is identical to Sony and I am using Akai music systems since 1981 when my father bought it for me"

288,4.1 out of 5,"I bought product when there was not any review available for this product. I ordered it thinking JBL will not disappoint me and i was true.

Before keeping this product i ordered thomsan soundbar, blaupunkt soundbar and boat one, returned all of them..they were not bad though. But i didn't want to compromise in audio quality.
This delivers what i needed, i. e. Correct frequency response. Some people complaining about low bass, let me mention it gives sound signature of JBL audio .it gives pure bass pleasant to ears not unnecessary booming like roadside dhoom dhadaka..i hope you understand what i am trying to say..i returned blaupunkt as the bass was extra boomy that ruins the melody of music..some people likes it but i don't. I prefer balanced sound signature. This delivers perfect bass response and the punch comes when it is needed..it is a mark of great sound signature..i can assure that after listening this even audiophiles will not complain. Maybe people who complaining about bass must replace their product, i am sure they got defective item.
It doesn't have bass and treble control feature but why someone need to disturb the sound signature by tweaking it. I don't feel any need, though it can be done with phone equalizer.
One addition - it has 3 equalizer preset modes present on remote. That works perfectly. game, music and cinema

Loudness is more than enough, i haven't played it at full volume as my windows started vibrating so i lowered it down. No one wants complains from neighbours.

Coming to build quality. It is perfect nothing to complain in this section.

It is the best one could get in this price range.
Usually i don't write reviews but i struggled a lot while ordering this unit as there was not a single review available for this, i hope this will help others a little bit."

314,3.5 out of 5,"I have been using this hometheatre system for last 10 days with all different kind of setups - Movie, music, gaming
So I believe am ready to give a review from a regular user usage feedback .
Firts things first
I got the product from the seller- Appario retail and they have given me an already opened + used product and I was really shocked to see that.
I was thinking whether to return it on the same day but thought of using it for once to see if it has any defects.
but surprisingly the speaker was all fine, dint fine any issues or something. so decided to keep the product anyway , so a bid thumb's down for the seller Appario retailers.
now coming back to the speaker performance
I don't knw why many reviews says that the Bass is not good, for me the bass is just perfect, I only set the bass level to 6 or to 8 max(out of 12) and the bass just pumps in perfectly and shakes my room pretty good.
I have been using it with PS4,LAPTOP,Tv, and Mobile and every ports does work but only the HDMI and Optical outputs 5.1 with ofcourse 5.1 content.
But worst+sad+bad thing with the setup is the sound bar channel seperation. i would say its 0 out of 5, yes the sound clarity is just sony level but u can't get or feel the front left+center+front right channel seperation from the sound bar, you can only feel the seperation if u sit just infront of the sound bar and within 1 meter distance, if you sit far than this u will just feel it like a 3.1 system ( 1 left rear + 1 right rear+ 1 front speaker) so u really won't get the Dolby theatre like feeling from this speakers even though they are marketed as a 5.1 I would suggest to go for Individual 5.1 speaker setup rather than the sound var setup if u r really a guy like me who give importance to the surrounding effect.
so this is my verdict,
if u just want a really good speaker system for music+regular media watching this speakers are fine, but if u mainly get this for the home theatre 5.1 experience dont go for it, go for a system which has either separate channel speakers or a better soundbar which can may be give much more channel seperation
thnx"

326,4 out of 5,"At first, I thought it would be a great deal, such a low price and much better sound quality as compared to that price.
I ordered it because I saw the same one in my colleague's office. It had a great sound quality so I thought maybe it is a good deal.
But, as soon as I received my order, I opened and tested it. Worked as expected initially, but only after 5 minutes I found that one of the speakers has stopped working! Well, thanks to Amazon's superb return and refund policy, I immediately returned it and got my money back.
Probably the seller may have shipped an old piece that was rusting in a corner, who knows, but one thing for sure, I won't buy it again..."

338,4.1 out of 5," Edit: Found one issue.
After 2 months, the suvwoofer suddenly stops by itself. So no bass, only the satelite speakers only. It has to restarted multiple times to get the subwoofer working again.
I have talked to the Customer Care, they wanted a video proof, which I have provided. But no responses even after 20 days. It must be circuit board issue.
Update: As per the Customer Care, the issue might be ""dry fault"" and as there is no service center in my town , it had to be fixed by s 3rd party service center. I went to one shop, and they opened it and adjusted the power cord to sit properly and the problem is fixed.

The below are true, only when its working well.
Clear bass and treble. pretty good for a small room. When connected with Aux, the audio quality is great.In other modes, its not that good. The volume knob has different level of volume increment compare to remote control. The remote contol is not intuitive. It seems there needs to be a different guide needed to operate remote control.
The equlizer modes seems to have less effect. FM also not have the same volume level as the other modes. Volume at 20 in FM is similar to 35 in other modes."

426,3.4 out of 5,Recently i have purchased this Tronica Ridham for my home. Liked the design. It's really Powerful Bluetooth tower Speaker. Volume is very loud. Bass is also very very high. Suitable for any party. Best part is that It comes with a free mic. Which can be used for any announcements. But you need to keep the mic very near to your mouth. Appart from this everything is best. I recommend it.

Pros:

Cons:
No optical input
No remote bass control
No HDMI input (ARC/eARC) - But then what else to expect in this price range. Consider it a suggestion.

Still for the sound quality it produces, I'm giving 5 stars. Keep it up Obage.

Edit: After 2 days of use, just noticed that the woofer can't distinguish between two immediate discreet beats and dostort them by combining the two. Happens with HQ audio. Seems the woofer is slow in processing HQ audio. That was unexpected. I am reducing 1 star for that. Rest everything is fine."

Modern LED TV has come a long way to shed the tag of being an idiot box. Now your LED TV house several patents and you can find the word ""Smart"" tagged to your TV.
If you look at the journey from being an idiot box to becoming a smart TV several issues have been addressed to make your viewing experience flawless.

However, if there is anything short in a LED TV it's the sound. Blame it on the sleek design or sheer negligence of designers, the sound in any LED TV is always far from satisfactory.

So I started my journey to seek the best companion for my TV and finally ended up with this.

I am not a geek when it comes to speakers. So here is my review in layman's language after 2 weeks of use/Abuse.

The Good Part

1. Bass, yes you heard it clear, Bass - Powerful Woofers, good enough to compete with the bachelor's party next door.
2. Design - The unit looks sturdy at the same time sleek.
3. Bluetooth performance - There is absolutely no delay in pairing and no breakage once its paired
4. Clear music with no hissing sound even at high volume. A wholesome experience while watching movies.
5. A cute but functional remote to make your life easy.
6. Good connectivity options- Bluetooth/Aux/SD Card Reader/Pen Drive.
7. FM, if you are into listening radio.

The Not So Good Part

1. I would have rated the product 5 if it were not for cheap LED lights. The moment the led light kicks in you get a feel of
a low-end Chinese product. Though there is an option to switch this off, it comes back once you restart the speaker.

2. An NFC pairing would have made the experience even better.

3. You need to find a delicate balance between bass and treble to make the most out of this speaker.

4. Missing option in remote to control the bass and treble.

Conclusion

A must buy if you struggling with the poor quality audio of your TV.
Hope the review was helpful, Please write in the comment box if you need any clarification on the product.

458,4.1 out of 5,"I have been using 301 for some time and loving it. I wanted to buy another sound system for my other room, so I called up Obage customer care. Those guys really guide well. I was surprised to know that 101, despite being costlier than 301, has lesser sound output than 301. But the cost difference is due to sound quality, not sound quantity.
So i bought 101 as I wanted soothing sound for my room.

I used 101 for few days and reached the following conclusion :

301 is for those people who like loud music, boomy bass, crisp highs. The loudness of 301 is certainly more than 101. 301 is a very bright sound system in terms of sound.

101 is very clear and soothing. It has deeper bass than 301. I was amazed to see that 101 reaches down to 40Hz of bass which is phenomenal for this cost. Highs are very decent in 101. For long hours of listening, 101 is perfect. It takes a certain amount of time for ears to get adjusted to the sound of 101 as it is very melodious, and once the ears get accustomed to 101, it is addictive! The sound stage of 101 is very wide and detailed. I can listen to all instruments clearly on 101. But 101 is not at all loud.

Now, when I am in a mood of listening to classical, ghazals, soft music, English Rock, hip hop, I go to 101. Even songs of Arijit or latest bollywood movies, if I want to listen on less sound, I go to 101. It is best for peaceful listening.

I go to 301 when i want to listen to loud music, bollywood item numbers, or even disturb the neighbors sometimes hahaha. 301 really spices up the surrounding.

My verdict : 301 is spicy, 101 is sweet. I love them both!"

I was surprised to know that 101, despite being costlier than 301, has lesser sound output than 301. But the cost difference is due to sound quality, not sound quantity.
So i bought 101 as I wanted soothing sound for my room.

I used 101 for few days and reached the following conclusion :

301 is for those people who like loud music, boomy bass, crisp highs. The loudness of 301 is certainly more than 101. 301 is a very bright sound system in terms of sound.

101 is very clear and soothing. It has deeper bass than 301. I was amazed to see that 101 reaches down to 40Hz of bass which is phenomenal for this cost. Highs are very decent in 101. For long hours of listening, 101 is perfect. It takes a certain amount of time for ears to get adjusted to the sound of 101 as it is very melodious, and once the ears get accustomed to 101, it is addictive! The sound stage of 101 is very wide and detailed. I can listen to all instruments clearly on 101. But 101 is not at all loud.

Now, when I am in a mood of listening to classical, ghazals, soft music, English Rock, hip hop, I go to 101. Even songs of Arijit or latest bollywood movies, if I want to listen on less sound, I go to 101. It is best for peaceful listening.

I go to 301 when i want to listen to loud music, bollywood item numbers, or even disturb the neighbors sometimes hahaha. 301 really spices up the surrounding.

My verdict : 301 is spicy, 101 is sweet. I love them both!"

482,4.2 out of 5,Best thing is bass... sound is ok ok with instruments but lyrics are good. If compony can do some changes with the lower area on which speaker is standing it will be better! As they are using low quality rubber which imbalance the speaker so i have to use a wooden stand! But It is a worth speaker must busy! ❤️👍🏻

For all who listening it on bluetooth you are not even getting half the sound.Try on a RCA-3.5MM you will see the difference.Doesn't even flutter on Full volume.Comming back to the sound quality it's simple awesome words can never define sound BUT you can't go wrong with this product."

Sound 5/5
Bluetooth 5/5 range 10 to 13
Buy it if your range is 3k.
don't go for 4k or 5k Homes theaters because if you purchase between 4k to 5k you will feel adding additional 1k or 2k you can take more better then it like sony."

581,3.4 out of 5,"I bought this boat Aavante Soundbar on 6th of August. I received the product on 7th, so the delivery was good.

The packaging of the product was also good.
-Coming to the product, we get a Soundbar, a wirless sub woofer, both powered individually.

-The box contains a remote, a 3.5 mm audio cable and some screws for wall mount.

-Build quality:

The product is well built. The subwoofer is of good quality wood. On first inspection, I found the grill to be a little filmsy in the front of the soudbar. So overall I would rate it 4/5.

-Sound quality:
The sound quality on this soundbar is really good. It has good highs with decent mids as well.
-The bass on the sub woofer is also good. But it lacks some strong kick to the bass.

-Connectivity: The best part of this soundbar is connectivity. It has all the ports that are needed for a soundbar. I tested with 3.5 mm audio jack and Bluetooth and both worked flawlessly.

I bought this at the price of ₹5400 including HDFC cards discount. So at this price it is a steal deal. I would update this review over time."

Proudly made in India

I was skeptical, even after seeing all many brand home theaters, what to buy ?
But I decided to go for this, considering its an Indian product and a new launch by Tronica.It seems be a very good decision.

I am writing this after using the speaker for 15 days.
For sound lovers , this is definitely a good catch.
As in this amount,we cant get such high quality anywhere else.

It is surely more than five stars!
Loved the features, all desired are there- fm/ pendrive/SD card/aux in front as well as rear / Bluetooth

I will not suggest to buy this product for home because we will end up loosing the Ambience of the house.

This is only the initial review. I am not sure whether it will work properly or not, now I doubt the chipset also.

I got this product only because it is Amazon fulfilled, but I don't think so Amazon cross check this product.

I hope the company will take the suggestion and improve the quality of the product specially the build quality."

762,3.2 out of 5,Value for money. The moment I unboxed the product I was happy. The quality of material and the look they had. The color I ordered was grey and looked perfect matching to my living room. The sound is amazing. Really happy with the product. Firstly I was doubtful when a few wrote bad reviews about the product but when I received and tested it myself I was wondering what even made them not like the product. Trust me the product is worth the money and perfect for your tv to turn into a home theater with this set. Make sure you place the speakers in place for better quality. Definitely suggesting this to my friends as the price too is quite reasonable. Thanks to tronica.

770,4.2 out of 5,"Well writing this review after thoroughly testing each feature.
It is an awesome product at this range and I bet you can't find something better and beautiful than this.
The build quality is way beyond what i expected.
It's a powerhouse with RGB Effects.
Especially the rich bass it has (with bluetooth connection through my smart phone), the audio quality is awesome and is very pleasant to listen.

FM radio works well but has little distortion in some channels (maybe had to fix the antenna outdoors) but it’s still give good output.
Bluetooth linking is the quickest !! It connects without any issues and has the best quality output
Very satisfied with the quality.
Just go for it👍"

1. You have a speaker but it's either not working anymore or it's not sounding good to your ears anyone, because when you listen to it with that comparative mindset, you are gonna love the sound it produces. I had a old 5.1 pc speakers which was actually 2.1.
2. You are looking for melody, sound clarity which is important for not only watching movies but also to songs. Volume is more than enough for my 10 x 12 room.
3. You are ready to Change the acoustics of the room (I did, after some research on placement of acoustics pads) , and it's critical for producing the true potential of these speakers.

I loved it.
My only wish these speakers last long! That's a thing remains to be seen."

But twice I tried to get a working piece and twice I got a set with one of the 4 satellite speakers not working. What are the odds of that happening by chance?

And yes, the speakers might be made in India. But the chipset is definitely Chinese - the lady speaking out the modes as they are changed has a distinct Chinese accent.

If you specifically want to listen to high quality music, look for a more powerful speaker - at least 15 watts with woofer."

Delivery: 5 days, Free, Bangalore
Package: Came in carton box, well protected, No damage
Returnable: Yes
Warranty: 1 Year

This is not for Audiophile freaks. This is for those who on tight budget but want some quality audio

Product package contains 2 Speaker towers, 3.5mm to 3.5mm Jack, 3.5mm to RCA, RCA to RCA (male), Remote with battery, User manual & Warranty Card. Supported sources are Bluetooth, Line In (AUX), FM Radio, USB/SD-MMC.

Highlights:
~~~~~~~~~
♦ FM Radio support with Aerial cable
♦ On-board buttons and a small LED display (For Volume, EQ, Mode)
♦ In-Built EQ modes (Jazz, Classic, Pop, Rock and couple more) - WORKS ONLY FOR BLUETOOTH & USB/SD
♦ USB/SD-MMC works on 32GB SD Card, resumes play exactly at same time after power failure
♦ Bluetooth range is good, works 10 feet about, Remote range is only about 5 feet
♦ 1 Year Warranty, Made in India

Audio Quality:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
♦ Highs are very crispy, no distortion up to 80% of volume (I turn down my treble control on Mobile slightly for even more comfortable listening)
♦ Bass gets as low as 50Hz, clear to the most part on Solo Bass(To get proper harmonics, need to take care of room acoustics)
♦ Bass is not boomy or muddy, clear but does not have rumbling effect like a Real Sub
♦ Bass is not as tight as say a Bookshelf, but clear and well controlled till 80% of Bass Volume
♦ Vocals are clear but dull, noticeably (3 inch driver's freq resp is more on highs)
♦ Background noise is very minimum on Bluetooth, but slight hum on Line-in (Perhaps due to my TV)
♦ USB/SD Playback volume is slightly louder than on Bluetooth
♦ Audio is NOT loud probably for Bed-room types, but perfect for long time listening!

Who should buy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. For listening Instruments and musics
2. For classical musics (Beethoven)
3. Jazz lovers
4. Bass lovers (Who are On low budget!)

--> Don't forget to Burn-in

Overall, A slight bigger size of the driver could have helped for the Vocal (Or perhaps a 3-way system). But for this price, this is a perfect buy!. Hope this review is helpful!"

Audio Quality:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
♦ Highs are very crispy, no distortion up to 80% of volume (I turn down my treble control on Mobile slightly for even more comfortable listening)
♦ Bass gets as low as 50Hz, clear to the most part on Solo Bass(To get proper harmonics, need to take care of room acoustics)
♦ Bass is not boomy or muddy, clear but does not have rumbling effect like a Real Sub
♦ Bass is not as tight as say a Bookshelf, but clear and well controlled till 80% of Bass Volume
♦ Vocals are clear but dull, noticeably (3 inch driver's freq resp is more on highs)
♦ Background noise is very minimum on Bluetooth, but slight hum on Line-in (Perhaps due to my TV)
♦ USB/SD Playback volume is slightly louder than on Bluetooth
♦ Audio is NOT loud probably for Bed-room types, but perfect for long time listening!

877,3.3 out of 5,"IMPORTANT NOTE:

First off all, getting a good surround system is dependent not only on the speakers but many other factors. Your experience is going to be poor no matter which sound system you buy unless you consider for these factors.

To get a good surround sound system you should consider:

1. Whether the content you're playing has a 5.1ch sound output in the first place

2. Whether the app and/or device you're playing it in supports a 5.1ch output (for e.g. YouTube app does not have a 5.1ch output)

3. Whether your connectivity supports a 5.1ch output; not all devices/connections support 5.1ch (for e.g. if you connect the speakers through a normal 3.5mm jack, you'll only get a stereo output)

So when comments here say the ""5.1 doesn't work"" take that not with a pinch of salt but with 'bunch' of salt.

I have been using the sound system for a little over 2 months and I can say with 100% confidence that it works with absolute charm!!

Therefore before you go ahead and make this purchase, please do find out if the device that you intend to hook this up with, has the capability to output 5.1ch through HDMI Arc connection. Not all TVs/devices support this, therefore you'll end up having all the devices but not getting the surround system feel.

Now coming to the sound system in itself.

It is a bit of a bummer that the Front Right, Centre and Front Left are in a single sound bar. Ideally you would want them to be slightly spaced. But there is the advantage of the soundbar fitting snugly right below the TV and looking pretty cool. It does give an artificial ""spacing"", so no complains here.

The Surround Left and Right satellites come with a 10m long wire. They need to be placed at 90-110° from where you sit and since most ideal TV viewing distances are less than 4m, there shouldnt be a problem with lack of length.

Please Google for speaker placement for 5.1ch and you'll come across Dolby recommended positions. Follow that and you're good to go!

The sound itself is amazing! Gives a very good cinematic experience (assuming you have considered all the aforementioned 3 factors). With HDMI Arc connectivity, you should be able to control the speaker volume with your TV remote itself, but this is something that you need to check with your TV."

The speaker shuts off randomly by itself and then I need to turn it on manually every time. I have witnessed the same issue when I used this speaker with other PCs and laptops as well. I don't know whether other people have ever experienced similar issues while using this speaker."

971,3 out of 5," This is the first time I’ve ordered from Elevn and I must say the quality of the speakers is great for music as well as movies. The speakers come with attached wires, one of which is the jack of 3.5 mm and the other is the power cable which you could either connect to your laptop or PC and can even be connected to a phone with the help of a power bank. The speakers also have a volume controller which makes it so much easier to increase or decrease volume and the best part is you can travel with these mini speakers as it is very convenient to carry them around. Overall I love the sound quality for the price that I paid and would definitely recommend people to go ahead and buy this product!"

FM is not working properly due to range issue and I don't know how to set antenna. Music is now working only with cable. i have to contact call center i don't know how far it will fix my problem. I will update my review keep following , if you interested in buying this speaker.
Contacted customer care mobile no given in product page. The person asked to contact another nos for service support. Two mobile nos switched off. Land line no 04442149116 which was always busy. Worst response. Not working with in 2days of delivery. Today I contacted zebronics no from the website, they are asking me to bring the speakers to service centre vepery ,Chennai, which is more than 50kms from my home. Again they had given new no that also not working. There is no solution. They don't bother once item is sold. Be CAREFUL. At last the engineer came to home and changed new circuit board , now its working."

Another major problem is that the wireless surround speakers suddenly start make a very loud crackling sound and i have to turn that off (sorted out by service engineer by putting the main unit far from wifi). HDMI sound output from tv is not working so I am using optical cable for sound from TV.
Never expected such a system from Sony and I purchased it on the first day of its launch just because it was a Sony product"

Worked perfectly as mentioned. Bluetooth volume is a little higher than Aux volume. It is almost parallel to Panasonic ht 21. Bass enclosure is sturdy and satellite speakers are light. Sound quality is good and clear. Bass is nice and my room 12x20ft room is booming like speaker enclosure. For some english songs I have to reduce bass in my player app for appropriate good bass. So far everything goes well as anticipated. I can’t understand why such a nice product Akai has very little response in market. Perhaps Indians are more incline to Philips, Sony and Panasonic. In audio systems Akai is identical to Sony and I am using Akai music systems since 1981 when my father bought it for me"
