0,4.4 out of 5,"Very Thin, light weight, fast boot, fast shut down. Longer battery life. You will love watching full HD or 4K videos on this display.

As I used for 2 days, so yet to validate battery strength on regular basis. I will share battery review after 1 week.
16GB Ram, L3 8MB, 6 core Ryzen 5, NVME, good finger print lock.
Delivered next day by Amazon.

Keyboard gives initial impact that keys lettersnew lineumbers could be bolder. But with continued use you may find it comfortable. I think silver background and light black text may gives illusion of thin text on keys. It might be due to my use of complete black body laptop with white text keys earlier. But not big deal.

Software is Win Home provided. Anti virus provided is McAfee which is one month free version. It could have been 1 year. Dropbox 12 month provided free, it could have been 1 month instead of McAfee. MS Office provided is desktop version. Office 365 is not included.

I will recommend better you order laptop cushion cover and keyboard cover with this. This generation laptops are very delicate not sterdy as like before"

4,3.7 out of 5,"After my 13inch MacBook I have tried several window laptops HP, Dell, Asus, Acer but this is first laptop that has amazed me with its extreme engineering design and a display to die for, stunning colours and best sound ever on a laptop, this beats MacBook retina display anyday and fast charge is amazing. I think it should be priced at 80k but surprisingly it's being sold at 69,999. The ports are more than adequate, the thunderbolt port and charging via USB is cherry on cake, fast charge, hdmi usb 3.2 port, only thing I felt was ram 8gb is just okay. You will forget hp, Lenovo and Dell and now I felt cheated on getting those mediocre specs and quality of laptops at 80k. You will not regret a bit once you hold this piece of beauty in your hands. WiFi 6 BT 5. Close your eyes and go for this you will love it and will become your routine companion. I have gray colour one and it's best. Fully recommend this laptop. Thanks Vaio for this amazing device."

20,4.1 out of 5,"A sleek compact light weight beauty. Going to surprise you how small it is yet it has an adequately sized 14 inch screen.
Pros:
Beautiful display, narrow bezels.
Fast - thanks to SSD.
Quite decent speakers. Clear and almost loud enough.
Instant and effective face recognition.
Good battery life - I get a good 8 hours atleast.
Keyboard is quite responsive.

Cons:
Mousepad gets laggy like once a day and idk maybe it's a driver issue but got to check that."

24,4.2 out of 5,"Laptop is decent. Problem is that the Acer Swift 3 (SF314-55G) comes with a i5 8265U, 72% NTSC panel, an SD card reader and MX 250 which undoubtedly is better than Ryzen integrated GPU. However, this laptop's screen is very washed out, colors lood really bad and unfortunately the pricing is almost 25% more than the variant I consider better. If you can't supply a good screen, it's a pointless laptop for me. Anyway, the Ryzen 4500U runs everything smoothly, this variant has 45% NTSC, no SD Card reader, slightly better keyboard, really bad speakers, wifi 6 is there but again, we're not ready for it...

I would not recommend to buy at this price point, wait for it to go to 45k like SF314-55G before purchasing."

32,4.1 out of 5,"Not for Gamers, High End Programmers, Multimedia Photo/Video Editors, CAD/CAM Users.

Compactness and small in size is key feature that will amaze you.

Recommendation
1. Suitable for students
2. Programmers can install lightweight IDE like VS code
3. Don't think of installing DB packages like Oracle, MySQL, MSSQL Server as their process keep running which will eat up memory RAM.
4. Ideal to keep this laptop if you have a high end desktop too. Intall big stuff there and work on either of your devices per your mobility needs. Like installing DB on desktop and doing development on this laptop.
5. Heavy multi tasking is not recommended i.e. keeping many applications running in taskbar must be avoided. Plan your work and divide and concur. Open application that is needed now and close once done.
6. Personal experience I keep Mail, MS Teams, VS Code for a 3000+ Java code files project, Few word and excel documents, Browser with average 8-10 tabs open and this doesn't lag.

Upgradable
RAM - no as this soldered to the motherboard
SSD - Yes as this has NVMe PCIe Gen 3 SSD with M-key. Form Factor: 2242. The slot can also support 2280 SSD upto 2TB (I will post review once I upgrade)

Best features
Dual band wifi5 ac protocol that gives immense speed and full utilization of my 100mbps connection.
Touch and feel like a premium laptop, smooth finish, fine edges.
Large keyboard keys doesn't feel clumsy.
Enough large touchpad too.
Goog battery backup between 4 - 6 hours depending upon brightness, process laptop is doing and WiFi usage while running on battery."

Ordered a replacement and still the same. Going back to tried and tested HP.

Update : problem occurred with HP too, was told the issue was unavailability of SSD. After installing SSD, HP machine was fast, maybe that was the issue with lenovo too"

40,3.7 out of 5,"this review after use of 5 days.
1. somebody has written that above 1TB external HD can't be used. I have used my 5TB HD for transfer of data. It is well connected and data transfer rate is good.
2. Office 360 is temporary. hence I installed my Microsoft office which works well.
3. Speed is little bit slow which u may not notice if single application has operated.
4. PC operates at 50 to 70 % of CPU and almost 80% of memory which make little worried to me.
5. I am also using it for delivering reports through service plus and meeting. Till yet no problems. Installed java for that.

finally, i can say as on date that for this price it is a good laptop. Keyboard is not Bluetooth and yes removable. screen has good clarity and not having good viewing angle. Speaker is pathetic but it is ok in room. Mic is fantastic. As compared to other chrome based, I prefer it, as I have to operate it for digital signature and service plus."

52,4.3 out of 5,"It is faster and more responsive than any other laptop I have worked on.

Why 4 stars? Because when I started using it, it killed my WiFi Router every time I tried to connect to the internet. All the devices connected to that router would loose internet connection if I connected this laptop.

Extensive research on the internet revealed that the Windows based pre-installed Lenovo apps like Lenovo Vantage may be responsible for the issue.

Why 4 stars? Because when I started using it, it killed my WiFi Router every time I tried to connect to the internet. All the devices connected to that router would loose internet connection if I connected this laptop.

Extensive research on the internet revealed that the Windows based pre-installed Lenovo apps like Lenovo Vantage may be responsible for the issue.

Clarifications/issue points:

1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.
2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.
3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.
4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.
5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)
6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.
7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.

I’ll update this review after one month of usage."

Actual product has silver colored keys with grey letter and there is a fingerprint reader. Refer ASUS official website for correct pics.

Things I liked:
- Light weight
- Bootup and shutdown speeds are good.
- Fast fingerprint reader.
- Good loud speakers.
- Premium look.

Things that could have been better..
- Display (Viewing angles are not that great. And I observed blue tint. Not sure if this is good for long sessions. I will have to find out.
- Keyboard (You cant see the letters on the keys from certain angles or lighting conditions. You will have to lean forward to see the letters. A black keyboard with white letters would have been better)
- Camera (Not at all good or I can say useless. I will give 1 out of 5 ratings for Camera)
- Left and Right click buttons make cheap clicky sound.

108,4.2 out of 5,"This laptop is perfect for home and student use. Don't get blindsided by the negative reviews. The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.

Benefits:
- Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter and battery gets warm which is quite normal.
- Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs.
- Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off.
- Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed.
- Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop.
- Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 40/100.
- Touchpad: smooth.
- Pre-activated Office 2019.

Note:
- Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.

- As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.

- In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know how to use it properly.

- At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.

- Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.

- If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop fan runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.

- DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.

- Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.

That's all folks!!!"

112,4.1 out of 5,"i will review in 3 stages good ,avg and bad

Good:
Processor r5 3450u (get your daily work done)
ssd 256gb(but u will get around 150-155gb after all necessary updates)
screen (no dead pixel and no screen bleeding....brightness can be a issue if you work outside mostly)
microphone (captures super crystal voice good for work from home )
easy to carry lightweight laptop and design is also good

Average:
build quality (build quality near trackpad is so poor that when you put your palm on palm rest it will click any button of trackpad)
camera(just that much that people can recognize you)
keyboard(you have to sacrifice with num pad)
speaker(my phones speaker is louder than this)
trackpad(small in size)
dell mobile connect(it is just useless ....believe me you never going to use it )

Bad:
Heat(heat is going to be a part of your life...it heat even after 10-15min of browsing )
battery(i dont know why but i was not able to charge my laptop 100%...charging stuck at 91%)

conclusion
1.when you want laptop with ryzen 5 processor +ssd with brand name like dell then only you can consider it and ofcourse you are on tight budget...and it is not for gaming(you can play low end games)
2. attending classes and daily work can be done easily"

124,4.4 out of 5,"Superb laptop at the perfect price, I am writing this review after 2 weeks of use, Actually, I bought this for my son's online classes and also thought of using it occasionally for my office work as well. It's actually a very good laptop for day-to-day usage, It has an i3 11th gen processor and 8 GB Ram with 256 GB SSD Ram a power pack machine.

It turns on when you open the lid and up for work just within 10 seconds thanks to the SSD Hard disk. I never find any lagging till now even doing multitasking due to better ram.

About Screen quality, so it has a good sharp, crisp, and clear screen however missing the IPS hence need to adjust the screen as per your sitting position.

The keyboard is very smooth and the number pad is separate which is actually good for work on excel and calculations. Also has dedicated multimedia keys. Backlight can be a plus point however if you are not working too much at the night then really doesn't matter.

About the battery backup so it works almost like 5 hours on battery and this laptop having a rapid charge function which charges the battery much faster. Thanks to Lenovo Vantage software which is giving multiple nice features.

Camera Quality: I have searched many laptops but only a few having good quality cameras, this laptop is one of them, It has a good 720P high-resolution camera useful for Office meetings, online classes and showing good impression.

it also has preinstalled Alexa which is useful for timepass in between.. Kids actually enjoy this.

I think have covered almost everything, there is still a few more good about it like 2 yrs warranty, a lifetime licence for windows 10 and MS-office for free and lifetime.

I am not a gamer so no idea about gaming and I guess for gamers and software developers i5 and i7 can be better options.

Overall this is the best Laptop for day to day work..

I hope this reveiw will be helpful for others... Thank you !!"

The keyboard is very smooth and the number pad is separate which is actually good for work on excel and calculations. Also has dedicated multimedia keys. Backlight can be a plus point however if you are not working too much at the night then really doesn't matter.

About the battery backup so it works almost like 5 hours on battery and this laptop having a rapid charge function which charges the battery much faster. Thanks to Lenovo Vantage software which is giving multiple nice features.

Camera Quality: I have searched many laptops but only a few having good quality cameras, this laptop is one of them, It has a good 720P high-resolution camera useful for Office meetings, online classes and showing good impression.

it also has preinstalled Alexa which is useful for timepass in between.. Kids actually enjoy this.

I think have covered almost everything, there is still a few more good about it like 2 yrs warranty, a lifetime licence for windows 10 and MS-office for free and lifetime.

I am not a gamer so no idea about gaming and I guess for gamers and software developers i5 and i7 can be better options.

Overall this is the best Laptop for day to day work..

I hope this reveiw will be helpful for others... Thank you !!"

- The best part is the thermal system of this laptop, literally, this laptop doesn't heat up which definitely extends the life your laptop.
- Almost all software available in the market is optimized to give the best performance with Intel processors and here you got the latest 11 generation intel i5 Hexa core processor.
- The build quality is best, the design is awesome and the performance is powerful.
- The typing experience you will get on this laptop is simply fabulous, better than Legion and Tuf laptop.
- You can easily open the laptop lid with a single hand.
- I use MATLAB and some CAD Softwares on this laptop which works very smoothly without any issue.
- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop. It lasts around 3 to 4 hrs for multitasking and heavy work.
- Recently, I have upgraded my laptop to windows 11 which is working fine.

- For the price of Rs. 36,500 this laptop is worth every penny.
- SSD hard drive, so no lag in opening and working on multiple stuff.
- received firmware update, which is really good.
- backlight for the Keyboard which you don't get even in a 40k worth HP laptop.
- Sound is pretty loud. Loud enough to attend calls, watch movies and listen to songs. Sound is crisp and there is no shrill sounds.
- Even the adapter for the laptop is not heavy.
- touch is smooth and multi finger gesture is also very smooth. No lag during zooming.
- Key travel on the keyboard is also good. Keys are soft.
- light weight and very sturdy build quality.
- Packaging had 2 carton layers and then the laptop carton box itself. Don't fear about any transit damages.
- Camera is good enough to have a decent clarity during the call. Its very good in well lit condition.
- Heat is very well managed and the fan sound is not audible during normal use.
Cons:
- Don't expect to play games in this laptop as this laptop is only for entertainment and study purpose. I dont play games so I dont care."

But the real problem is the display, it's 720p which is good for the price, but it has colour shifting problem like an TN display. The white balance is out of this world and there is no option to change it on the chromebook. So you need to live with it.

1. Its build quality is decent. Body is made up of PC + ABS (Top), PC + ABS (Bottom). It is not metal or aluminium. I had bad experience with metallic Laptop (HP) where there was current and electric shock in laptop. So ABS is good if not better.
2. RAM is 4GB Soldered DDR4-3200 + 4GB SO-DIMM DDR4-3200 dual channel RAM Setup. So max RAM can be 12GB
3. Storage is latest 512GB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0x4 NVMe not SATA and it supports Up to 2 drives, 1x 2.5"" HDD + 1x M.2 2242/2280 SSD. So HDD can be put.
4. WLAN + Bluetooth™ is latest version
11ac, 2x2 (wifi 6) + BT5.0
5. Office Home and Student 2019 is lifetime free after registration
6. Finger print sensor is present which works good
7. Privacy shutter is there
8. Fast charging support is there – charges 80% in 60 min

Why I chose over HP 1030AU (5500U)

1. It is almost 2-3 thousand cheaper
2. Wifi 6 in idea pad vs wifi 5
3. Blutooth newer version is present in ideapad (v5 vs 4.2)
4. Privacy shuter in idea pad
5. Dual channel (4+4gb 3200MHz) better than 8GB Single channel
6. Finger print sensor
7. Better Screen – 300Nits Anti glare IPS Screen vs 250 Nits ips panel.
8. Can add extra HDD in idea pad. Not sure about Hp 1030.

206,4.6 out of 5,"This is small review for Potential buyers of Lenovo idea pad 3 (2021) Ryzen 5500u version 82KT00BXIN and why I chose it over HP 1030AU (5500U) -

1. Its build quality is decent. Body is made up of PC + ABS (Top), PC + ABS (Bottom). It is not metal or aluminium. I had bad experience with metallic Laptop (HP) where there was current and electric shock in laptop. So ABS is good if not better.
2. RAM is 4GB Soldered DDR4-3200 + 4GB SO-DIMM DDR4-3200 dual channel RAM Setup. So max RAM can be 12GB
3. Storage is latest 512GB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0x4 NVMe not SATA and it supports Up to 2 drives, 1x 2.5"" HDD + 1x M.2 2242/2280 SSD. So HDD can be put.
4. WLAN + Bluetooth™ is latest version
11ac, 2x2 (wifi 6) + BT5.0
5. Office Home and Student 2019 is lifetime free after registration
6. Finger print sensor is present which works good
7. Privacy shutter is there
8. Fast charging support is there – charges 80% in 60 min

Why I chose over HP 1030AU (5500U)

1. It is almost 2-3 thousand cheaper
2. Wifi 6 in idea pad vs wifi 5
3. Blutooth newer version is present in ideapad (v5 vs 4.2)
4. Privacy shuter in idea pad
5. Dual channel (4+4gb 3200MHz) better than 8GB Single channel
6. Finger print sensor
7. Better Screen – 300Nits Anti glare IPS Screen vs 250 Nits ips panel.
8. Can add extra HDD in idea pad. Not sure about Hp 1030.

RAM is Samsung brand and SSD is Micron brand."
207,4.5 out of 5,"I won't tell all good things which YouTube channels are promoting. Good part is overall laptop is good. I will rate 3.5 star out of 5.

Now why 3.5 stars:
1. The edges to open lid with single hand are super sharp one can get easily scratched.
2. Super con - no grip. Seriously MI forgot to put grip below laptop. It doesn't stick to the table and slide like seesaw.
3. Speakers are poor
4. No camera shutter for privacy and yes camera is of poor quality doesn't even feel like 720p
5. Thermal go high on and above keyboard area while charging
6. Type C charge provide is of super cheap quality - utter cost cutting. Definately one need to spend 2k just after a year or so because its not going to last long
7. No idea about after sale service
8. 16:10 is just gimmick - ran Sheehan on amazon prime the video filled 50% portion of the screen and rest was black

After using it for few days I feel this laptop 16GB+I5 is bit highly priced. It should be somewhere between 50-55k not more than that. Come on MI you are not a well established brand in laptop world like hp or dell, you should have atleast provided an aggressive pricing.

So to conclude it finally, if you can live with above cons go ahead and buy it. It will serve your purpose for next 4-5yrs"

Although the battery is not that good, maybe I'm feeling that cause I use internet alot. But as the I would say you should go for it. It's a great buy."

215,5 out of 5,"This laptop is perfect for home and student use. Don't get blindsided by the negative reviews. The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.

Benefits:
- Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter and battery gets warm which is quite normal.
- Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs.
- Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off.
- Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed.
- Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop.
- Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 40/100.
- Touchpad: smooth.
- Pre-activated Office 2019.

Note:
- Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.

- As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.

- In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know how to use it properly.

- At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.

- Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.

- If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop fan runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.

- DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.

- Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.

That's all folks!!!"

Performance: 4/5. Would have been better if ryzen 5600u was present instead of Intel.
Screen: 4.5/5. No bleeding issues. Contrast and colors are good. It is a glossy screen so -.5 stars
Built Quality: 5/5. Not comparable to think book but it is good. This is gen2 laptop which has the mil rating. Gen3 has no such rating for some reason but it comes with ryzen chip. Laptop is on the heavier side compared to thinkpads but can't complain at this price point.
Ports 5/5. Best feature IMO. It has a thunderbolt port which is missing from Gen3. So you can use a thunderbolt dock or attach an e GPU
Speakers: 3/5. Loud enough but no bass.
Touch/Pen/Convertible: Pen has good latency. I didn't see any lag. Touch is accurate. Hinges are sturdy but only time will tell how long it will last.
Keyboard: 4/5. Good enough but not comparable to thinkpads.

There are certain compromises but overall I am very happy. It ticks most of the boxes."

It has a 8gigs of RAM, 2gigs of graphic memory (RX vega 3), fast processor, 256gigs of memory which is enough if you don't want to install big files/games in it.
PS: Good for programming!
It can handle softwares which require graphic memory descently(I've tried playing old games like nfsmw 2005, gts vc and San Andreas which ran smoothly, storage problem may occur if you will try to install too many at once, so keep a check on it)
Also, softwares like Android Studio, AutoCAD 2022, Unity 3d, Unreal Engine 4 run smoothly on it.
Gta 5 can run on it too at low settings smoothly but heating issue will pop up then!

Battery is good(can run upto 6-7 hrs if not doing heavy gaming or similar work, 2-3 hrs if gaming /using heavy softwares continuously.

Overall, a good laptop!"

283,4.8 out of 5,"Bought the Mi Ultra laptop during the first sale on 31st Aug. Extremely disappointed with the laptop as well as Mi Support.

12/09: Laptop doesn't turn on anymore. It has been 10 days, so cannot even return it. On the 6th day, the laptop went into a continuous restart loop which I fixed with hard shut down 3 times after watching some YouTube videos. And then it was working okay for 2 days. Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!

Update 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!

Update 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!

Just lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.

23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky. Else, I would have got a repaired one.

Anyway, I'm happy I got a new replacement laptop and currently it's working well."

295,3.9 out of 5,"This is the review of the 16-e0162AX model [ AMD Ryzen 5 with Radeon RX5500M GPU ]

The system is exactly the same as the GTX 1650 variant except for the GPU. In papers Radeon RX5500M is better than GTX 1650.

For the first impression, I like the overall design of the laptop.
The screen looks fantastic. One of the major issue highlighted is the refresh rate but I do play games with PS4 connected to my TV / Projector and they are all 60 Hz only and I don't find it really bothering

Keyboard is fun to type. Its backlit but only single color and brightness. The power button is part of the keyboard layout which requires us to be careful not to press it while trying to use the function keys

The trackpad is one of the best I would say. While typing this comment, multiple times my palm have pressed the trackpad but it didn't interfered [Awesome]. The tracking was smooth. When it comes to games, a wired mouse is a must though

It right away allowed me to upgrade to Windows 11. With a few documented changes, it does looks pretty familiar with Windows 10. I don't see any performance degradation with the upgrade as of now. Time will tell

The best part is inclusion of Microsoft office 2019 version which is a fully licensed version. Not many gaming laptop have this and is very useful

The integrated GPU have 512 MB DDR4 dedicated memory and the dedicated graphics card have 4GB GDDR6 RAM which should be able to handle most of the AAA games. Will try out few titles and update my review from Gaming perspective

Now to the not so fun part.
As many have pointed out in the review of the GTX 1650, the wobbling of the screen is noticeable but haven't interfered with my usage. May affect gaming, time will tell

The included 8 GB RAM may not be enough as with nothing additional installed in the machine, currently the memory usage is at 65%. Good thing is the entire 8 GB is in single slot allowing you to add additional 16 GB RAM in the empty slot

The unknown facts

Have read reviews in the GTX 1650 model that the dedicated graphics is used all the time and there's not setting to disable and use the integrated GPU [to save battery while not gaming]. But with this laptop, I am facing the reverse. My usage of the last 8 hours, only my integrated graphics was used and the dedicated graphics is idle. I am not sure if it will only be activated while gaming. Have to check it out
The reduction in 1 star is only related to this GPU issue. I might update my rating after getting some answers

Overall, it's worth the money. If you want a performance laptop without burning through your savings, you can buy this without a second thought. If you are a pro gamer, better to go with other brands with RTX 3xxx and above GPU with 144 Hz and above screen refresh rate"

The included 8 GB RAM may not be enough as with nothing additional installed in the machine, currently the memory usage is at 65%. Good thing is the entire 8 GB is in single slot allowing you to add additional 16 GB RAM in the empty slot

The unknown facts

Have read reviews in the GTX 1650 model that the dedicated graphics is used all the time and there's not setting to disable and use the integrated GPU [to save battery while not gaming]. But with this laptop, I am facing the reverse. My usage of the last 8 hours, only my integrated graphics was used and the dedicated graphics is idle. I am not sure if it will only be activated while gaming. Have to check it out
The reduction in 1 star is only related to this GPU issue. I might update my rating after getting some answers

Overall, it's worth the money. If you want a performance laptop without burning through your savings, you can buy this without a second thought. If you are a pro gamer, better to go with other brands with RTX 3xxx and above GPU with 144 Hz and above screen refresh rate"
297,3.9 out of 5,"This is the review of the 16-e0162AX model [ AMD Ryzen 5 with Radeon RX5500M GPU ]

The system is exactly the same as the GTX 1650 variant except for the GPU. In papers Radeon RX5500M is better than GTX 1650.

For the first impression, I like the overall design of the laptop.
The screen looks fantastic. One of the major issue highlighted is the refresh rate but I do play games with PS4 connected to my TV / Projector and they are all 60 Hz only and I don't find it really bothering

Keyboard is fun to type. Its backlit but only single color and brightness. The power button is part of the keyboard layout which requires us to be careful not to press it while trying to use the function keys

The trackpad is one of the best I would say. While typing this comment, multiple times my palm have pressed the trackpad but it didn't interfered [Awesome]. The tracking was smooth. When it comes to games, a wired mouse is a must though

It right away allowed me to upgrade to Windows 11. With a few documented changes, it does looks pretty familiar with Windows 10. I don't see any performance degradation with the upgrade as of now. Time will tell

The best part is inclusion of Microsoft office 2019 version which is a fully licensed version. Not many gaming laptop have this and is very useful

The integrated GPU have 512 MB DDR4 dedicated memory and the dedicated graphics card have 4GB GDDR6 RAM which should be able to handle most of the AAA games. Will try out few titles and update my review from Gaming perspective

311,4.4 out of 5,"I purchased this PC for my daughter school use.. It has a nvme drive (which is ligtniging fast) and 8 GB ram.

Performance is decent. It comes with some bloat ware like lenovo tools, mcaffee anti-virus etc.. I promptly removed the mcafee antivirus (which is only a trial version), and the perfomeance improved quite a bit.

I wish the display has 16:10 ratio, so it would have been much better for web browsing, online classes etc, but looks like only macbook has this display ratio.

I am now dual booting with Linux Elemenatary OS, and it is remarkably much quicker to boot, much faster than windows.

I am okay with the machine, I would have preffered to save on the unnecessary cost of Windows, as I am not usiing it.

There are also a few brands like HP selling at this price point, I picked this one though due to the lighted keypad and fingerprint scanner.

Camera and speakers are okay.. Just laptop quality.. External webcams will be better."

1- 4GB Ram and only one RAM slot. So you will have to replace the existing 4gb ram with the new ram as only one ram slot. Thanks to ddr4 3200 MHz slot.
2- Only two SSD slot, No SATA slot for HDD. Only m.2 SSD support.
3- No wifi 6. It supports upto 5 ghz and dual band wifi support.(This is not a deal breaker but people looking for wifi 6 this is something which may matter for you. But wifi performance is great even in dual band."
339,4.5 out of 5,"This is the first time i'm writing review for any product as I don't want people to make mistake of buying this product.
its not even a month that I've brought the product and facing below issues:
1.on 13th day after resetting the pin the screen went black, I waited for 10-15 mints and had to restart the system.this is not expected from a brand new laptop.
2.speakers are worst they seems to be working fine when the product arrived but within in 10 15 days. the speaker seems to be of poor quality.
3.on 16th day I discovered \ | and # buttons don't work some other character gets typed with those keys..this is super weird.

will keep adding to the list as and when I discover new flaws as its not even a month now and daily i'm facing new issues.

irony is 7 days return window is over for me so amazon is not ready to take return and I'm stuck with this stupid product.
this is what you get after spending such hefty amount on a product. on Amazon.
Worst Seller. and big kudos to amazon for allowing such sellers on their platform.

P.S: I would advice you to buy from the brand's sites or store and not buy such fake products from Amazon.

Edit one: within a month the touch stopped working. had to go through the headache of contacting the customer care for the 4th time with a month..
Edit two: within 2 months - I started the laptop and the screen went black. since it was a Sunday, so Lenovo customer support was not available on calls...one more headache added. Thanks for this Amazon and Lenovo!"
