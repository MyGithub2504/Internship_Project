16,4.2 out of 5,"Previous owner of Redmi 7 2gb 32gb
Redmi Note 10 4gb 64gb was blazing fast

If you aren't able to buy this wait till Xiaomi release the same in poco with 6gb ram for the same price, like they did with Redmi power with a downgrade in camera, They won't remove the 48mp camera, They may decrease or remove the remaining cameras in poco version of resmi note 10

About Amazon sale I logged in to amazon.in in my pc and clicked on join wait list around 12:02, then opened the app and booked the phone I was in queue for almost 20 to 25 minutes, the next step was payment which was a pain in the head, no COD, Note: only upi ids with number@ are accepted, I added a card Note: Check if ecommerce payments is enabled for your card

In the allocated 15 minutes the order was booked but payment failed, thankfully I was allowed to pay again

Also while I was waiting in queue I got an option to buy the phone 2 ways, lightning deal - 11998, Regular price - 11999 (in Amazon App), I think lightning deal is for those who want to claim offers

First of all, i bought this phone for basic use online payments, govt apps like Twallet, Tration, Tappfolio, MyGHMC, Digilocker, Aadhaar, Hpgas, Bharatgas, Hmwssb and much more all of them mostly dual apps

I am a pc user so I don't use my mobile for gaming or streaming

Pros:
Display : The display is crisp and clear better than my Redmi 7 (not comparing LCD with Amoled)
Touch: The touch response is good it's fast, I can type fast in this phone no lag there
Mobile data: 4g Data connectivity is superb I can feel the difference between my redmi 7 and this, mostly the download speed
Feel: In hand feel is also good, the weight is less
Camera: Best in the segment (obviously if you don't use the stock app)
Price: considering how this is priced more than Redmi Note 9 (10999), I am not angry this too will cost the same after 6 months probably will be on exchange and discount by August independence day sale.

Cons:
Battery: Being amoled this shouldn't consume so much battery, hope Xiaomi fixes this with an update
Plastic back: glossy back (should have come with matte or rough panel for better grip) and little bit of vibration while playing the speakers especially on top near camera
Stereo speakers: yep more like dual speakers than stereo (then again Xiaomi never claimed that they support Dolby (Oppo has them and they sound awesome)

Verdict: I was waiting for this from almost a year, from the launch of Redmi note 8 and my analysis went way deep, I was looking at Samsung for amoled, Redmi power for stereo speakers and good battery, Poco varient of Redmi note 9 for the processor and decent in the box fast charger

This covered almost all of them (not fully though)

Finally this just serves my purpose, I still aim to buy a good PC, Nothing can beat a desktop ( I wish remix os and phoenix os were as competitive as Windows, remix went out of play long back.",4.2

1. Narzo sure does feel premium compare to Poco. It's OS is clean and blotware free.
2. Narzo feels much lighter, but I weigh on scale Poco and Narzo weighs the same. I think Narzo has better weight distribution.
3. Camera is good. I feel no difference compare to Poco. Night camera is average, it cannot capture all the details what our eyes can see in low light. Poco too doesn't fair well in low light.
4. Calling is okay. Speaker volume is much low: forget using speaker phone. Poco has very loud speaker volume. This is only downside.
5. I liked Amazon giving flat exchange for older phones, albeit lower than Flipkart. Flipkart devalued my phone further upon inspection even though phone met all the checks.

Every thing is same except back cover design.
We can see model name as 'C11 2021' in 'about phone' setting of Narzo 50i.
Worst part is we can get 'C11 2021' at Rs.900/- less than 'Narzo 50i'.

Didn't expect this from Realme.

116,4.2 out of 5,"Previous owner of Redmi 7 2gb 32gb
Redmi Note 10 4gb 64gb was blazing fast

If you aren't able to buy this wait till Xiaomi release the same in poco with 6gb ram for the same price, like they did with Redmi power with a downgrade in camera, They won't remove the 48mp camera, They may decrease or remove the remaining cameras in poco version of resmi note 10

About Amazon sale I logged in to amazon.in in my pc and clicked on join wait list around 12:02, then opened the app and booked the phone I was in queue for almost 20 to 25 minutes, the next step was payment which was a pain in the head, no COD, Note: only upi ids with number@ are accepted, I added a card Note: Check if ecommerce payments is enabled for your card

In the allocated 15 minutes the order was booked but payment failed, thankfully I was allowed to pay again

Also while I was waiting in queue I got an option to buy the phone 2 ways, lightning deal - 11998, Regular price - 11999 (in Amazon App), I think lightning deal is for those who want to claim offers

First of all, i bought this phone for basic use online payments, govt apps like Twallet, Tration, Tappfolio, MyGHMC, Digilocker, Aadhaar, Hpgas, Bharatgas, Hmwssb and much more all of them mostly dual apps

I am a pc user so I don't use my mobile for gaming or streaming

Pros:
Display : The display is crisp and clear better than my Redmi 7 (not comparing LCD with Amoled)
Touch: The touch response is good it's fast, I can type fast in this phone no lag there
Mobile data: 4g Data connectivity is superb I can feel the difference between my redmi 7 and this, mostly the download speed
Feel: In hand feel is also good, the weight is less
Camera: Best in the segment (obviously if you don't use the stock app)
Price: considering how this is priced more than Redmi Note 9 (10999), I am not angry this too will cost the same after 6 months probably will be on exchange and discount by August independence day sale.

Cons:
Battery: Being amoled this shouldn't consume so much battery, hope Xiaomi fixes this with an update
Plastic back: glossy back (should have come with matte or rough panel for better grip) and little bit of vibration while playing the speakers especially on top near camera
Stereo speakers: yep more like dual speakers than stereo (then again Xiaomi never claimed that they support Dolby (Oppo has them and they sound awesome)

Verdict: I was waiting for this from almost a year, from the launch of Redmi note 8 and my analysis went way deep, I was looking at Samsung for amoled, Redmi power for stereo speakers and good battery, Poco varient of Redmi note 9 for the processor and decent in the box fast charger

This covered almost all of them (not fully though)

Finally this just serves my purpose, I still aim to buy a good PC, Nothing can beat a desktop ( I wish remix os and phoenix os were as competitive as Windows, remix went out of play long back.",4.2
