HDMI is recommended\\n\\nNeed to check the durability.\",\n",

So can't connect to ext. speaker (I have that in RT240Y, so I like it better in this feature)\\n2) The screen seems to be less vibrant with a bit over flashy white in terms of colour output.

I wanted the entire unit more Sturdy if possible\\n\\nOverall, a good buy & I can definitely recommend.

       " 'I have purchased this monitor for my personal use and fulfilling my long time fantasy of owning a beautiful sweet rig. My observations and thoughts on this panel, I have shared below.\\n\\n34\", Curved, 21:9, 3440x1440, IPS Display\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis size in particular, and the fact that it is curved, makes it a brilliant monitor to use as it covers your complete field of view. The resolution is plentiful, providing a whole lot of real estate, and so far I\\'ve used 5 windows simultaneously, comfortably. That included 2 Excel Documents, Visual Studio, WebEx (call) and Mattermost (chat).\\n\\nAdditional benefits (I use Citrix), the remote desktop clients actually consume lesser data and run smoother. Yeah, because the way these remote desktop clients is by sending data about things that have changed on the screen. And since you are not minimizing and switching windows around that much, it ends up consuming less data than a regular 1080p monitor.\\n\\nThe color reproduction is great, covers the sRGB scale completely (as per official specs), which makes it great for use in Photography, Cinematography and design work. Note that I would not recommend a curved screen to people who work with straight lines (like AutoCAD, and other such kinds of design softwares and tools).\\n\\nSimply, a very clean and clear image, I do not see any uneven lighting or backlight bleeding on this display. The display angles are really good, and is extremely comfortable to use. No eye strain noticed either.\\n\\nPeak brightness is 300 Nits, which I\\'ve found more than adequate for use in my room. Most of the time during the day, I find myself using the screen at about 40-50% brightness, and at night I bring it down to 5-10% brightness.\\n\\nHDR\\n-------\\nThis is an 8-bit + FRC panel, and is not a true 10-bit HDR display. While it does support HDR, I haven\\'t had a chance to notice the difference as significantly, tried playing some HDR youtube videos, which look fantastic as it is, need to try some true 10-bit HDR videos. For some reason, Windows 10 shows me the display as HDR compatible when I\\'ve connected with USB-C but not when using the DisplayPort. It\\'s probably a thing with my laptop itself, my personal laptop being a little older. Will update this section whenever I have more information on this.\\n\\n100 Hz\\n------------\\nRuns really smooth, especially a huge step up coming from a 60 Hz display. Beyond this refresh rate would also be smoother, but not as perceivable. I ain\\'t a hardcore or a professional gamer, so 100Hz felt like a great improvement even over the games that I usually play.\\n\\nEven supports full 4k signal\\n--------------------------------------------\\nNot much to say here, it just does, adding the fact here. Of course it\\'s not the native resolution and doesn\\'t look too great. Probably useful if you plan on plugging in a Fire Stick or something.\\n\\n1 ms MPRT\\n-------------------\\nMotion Picture Response Time is what MPRT is, for the curious. What it does is reduce ghosting or trailing of images on the screen. For example, moving your mouse around on the screen, you will generally see a smooth trail of the mouse behind it, fading out. With MPRT turned on, that trail is just a single ghost image, drastically improving perception of movement generally in games. I tested this on CS:GO, and I could definitely see the difference. In case you want to test it too, just search for UFO Display Test on the web.\\n\\nFreesync\\n--------------\\nThis monitor does support FreeSync, which works natively with AMD cards, and works with Nvidia 10 series and onwards. I could not test this, since mine is a GTX970M. Note that FreeSync cannot be used in conjunction with HDR or MPRT. For that, you will have to look for FreeSync 2 models of G-Sync Ultimate. Both of which are much much more expensive than this monitor.\\n\\nShower Lights\\n-----------------------\\nWhat I\\'m talking about, is that this monitor also has ambient lighting under the monitor, and it looks glorious! The only things, is that I only liked the white and the red modes. Very selective colors are available (white, blue, red, orange, green). It is not RGB, does not sync with the display, but the light does looks beautiful. There are certain modes too, like fixed, breathing, flashing, and ripple. Ripple is nice, but only to just show off, it is distracting otherwise. Fixed looks pleasant. Others are just, there. Some more customisability would have just made it amazing. Also the light isn\\'t continuous, but interleaved, so anything reflective under the monitor may not look good, but if you have a non backlit keyboard like mine, it does help shower some light on the keyboard too, a very subtle but neat effect!\\n\\nStand and overall look\\n-----------------------------------\\nThis monitor is simply gorgeous to look at, all the details are sharp and neat, the stand is really, really sexy, but does take up a lot of desk space. Amazing adjustability, height, tilt, swivel, everything can be adjusted, and very effortlessly so. Extremely smooth motion and gives all the feel of a premium product, that you would expect out of it. The monitor is compatible with a VESA 100mm mount, and does come with the mount adapter. In case you want to mount it, you need to get the wall section separately.\\n\\nConnectivity\\n--------------------\\nThis monitor has quite a good deal of inputs- 2 HDMI 2.0 ports, 1 DisplayPort 1.2 and one USB Type-C in. This monitor comes with a 180W power brick, and can easily charge your laptop too, all with a single USB-C cable. Makes for an extremely clean setup. Using the USB Type-C in, you get access to 4 USB 3.0 ports at the back of the monitor, that you can make use of. In my setup, one comes to the RGB mat, one to the webcam, one to my comms headphones and one I have vacant. The mouse and keyboard receivers I plug in to the source that I\\'m using directly instead of the monitor, mainly because the source I change occasionally (between my work and personal laptop). In case you have multiple laptops that can make use of the USB Type-C, it makes sense to plug it behind the monitor directly.\\n\\nOne quirk is the input ports, that are a bit difficult to plug in to. Anyhow, those are set once, and everything happens on the other end, so not much to complain about.\\n\\nConclusion\\n------------------\\nOverall, this monitor just ticks all the right boxes, violates none. It is a beautiful display to look at and work with, rendering the display beautifully, evenly and smoothly. Lots and lots of real estate make this highly recommendable, and you should definitely avoid 1080p ultrawides if your objective is productivity. That resolution barely adds 1.3 times the real estate as a normal 1080p display. For the price, this is a mid-tier monitor (but really expensive generally for the Indian consumers). Of course, you would go for this monitor only if your work would really benefit from owning such a monitor, or you are a gaming enthusiast, or you just have a lot of money to splurge and don\\'t know what else to do with it. Anyhow, this is a great purchase, and makes for a superb purchase, and one damn beautiful upgrade for your rig. Also to be noted, is that this monitor comes with a 3-year warranty, which for a purchase of this cadre, is a must. Having used Acer monitors in the past, and for this recent purchase of mine, I can highly recommend this.',\n",

I ain\\'t a hardcore or a professional gamer, so 100Hz felt like a great improvement even over the games that I usually play.\\n\\nEven supports full 4k signal\\n--------------------------------------------\\nNot much to say here, it just does, adding the fact here. Of course it\\'s not the native resolution and doesn\\'t look too great. Probably useful if you plan on plugging in a Fire Stick or something.\\n\\n1 ms MPRT\\n-------------------\\nMotion Picture Response Time is what MPRT is, for the curious. What it does is reduce ghosting or trailing of images on the screen. For example, moving your mouse around on the screen, you will generally see a smooth trail of the mouse behind it, fading out. With MPRT turned on, that trail is just a single ghost image, drastically improving perception of movement generally in games. I tested this on CS:GO, and I could definitely see the difference. In case you want to test it too, just search for UFO Display Test on the web.\\n\\nFreesync\\n--------------\\nThis monitor does support FreeSync, which works natively with AMD cards, and works with Nvidia 10 series and onwards. I could not test this, since mine is a GTX970M. Note that FreeSync cannot be used in conjunction with HDR or MPRT. For that, you will have to look for FreeSync 2 models of G-Sync Ultimate. Both of which are much much more expensive than this monitor.\\n\\nShower Lights\\n-----------------------\\nWhat I\\'m talking about, is that this monitor also has ambient lighting under the monitor, and it looks glorious! The only things, is that I only liked the white and the red modes. Very selective colors are available (white, blue, red, orange, green). It is not RGB, does not sync with the display, but the light does looks beautiful. There are certain modes too, like fixed, breathing, flashing, and ripple. Ripple is nice, but only to just show off, it is distracting otherwise. Fixed looks pleasant. Others are just, there. Some more customisability would have just made it amazing. Also the light isn\\'t continuous, but interleaved, so anything reflective under the monitor may not look good, but if you have a non backlit keyboard like mine, it does help shower some light on the keyboard too, a very subtle but neat effect!\\n\\nStand and overall look\\n-----------------------------------\\nThis monitor is simply gorgeous to look at, all the details are sharp and neat, the stand is really, really sexy, but does take up a lot of desk space. Amazing adjustability, height, tilt, swivel, everything can be adjusted, and very effortlessly so. Extremely smooth motion and gives all the feel of a premium product, that you would expect out of it. The monitor is compatible with a VESA 100mm mount, and does come with the mount adapter. In case you want to mount it, you need to get the wall section separately.\\n\\nConnectivity\\n--------------------\\nThis monitor has quite a good deal of inputs- 2 HDMI 2.0 ports, 1 DisplayPort 1.2 and one USB Type-C in. This monitor comes with a 180W power brick, and can easily charge your laptop too, all with a single USB-C cable. Makes for an extremely clean setup. Using the USB Type-C in, you get access to 4 USB 3.0 ports at the back of the monitor, that you can make use of. In my setup, one comes to the RGB mat, one to the webcam, one to my comms headphones and one I have vacant. The mouse and keyboard receivers I plug in to the source that I\\'m using directly instead of the monitor, mainly because the source I change occasionally (between my work and personal laptop). In case you have multiple laptops that can make use of the USB Type-C, it makes sense to plug it behind the monitor directly.\\n\\nOne quirk is the input ports, that are a bit difficult to plug in to. Anyhow, those are set once, and everything happens on the other end, so not much to complain about.\\n\\nConclusion\\n------------------\\nOverall, this monitor just ticks all the right boxes, violates none. It is a beautiful display to look at and work with, rendering the display beautifully, evenly and smoothly. Lots and lots of real estate make this highly recommendable, and you should definitely avoid 1080p ultrawides if your objective is productivity. That resolution barely adds 1.3 times the real estate as a normal 1080p display. For the price, this is a mid-tier monitor (but really expensive generally for the Indian consumers). Of course, you would go for this monitor only if your work would really benefit from owning such a monitor, or you are a gaming enthusiast, or you just have a lot of money to splurge and don\\'t know what else to do with it. Anyhow, this is a great purchase, and makes for a superb purchase, and one damn beautiful upgrade for your rig. Also to be noted, is that this monitor comes with a 3-year warranty, which for a purchase of this cadre, is a must. Having used Acer monitors in the past, and for this recent purchase of mine, I can highly recommend this.',\n",
       " 'I have purchased this monitor for my personal use and fulfilling my long time fantasy of owning a beautiful sweet rig. My observations and thoughts on this panel, I have shared below.\\n\\n34\", Curved, 21:9, 3440x1440, IPS Display\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis size in particular, and the fact that it is curved, makes it a brilliant monitor to use as it covers your complete field of view. The resolution is plentiful, providing a whole lot of real estate, and so far I\\'ve used 5 windows simultaneously, comfortably. That included 2 Excel Documents, Visual Studio, WebEx (call) and Mattermost (chat).\\n\\nAdditional benefits (I use Citrix), the remote desktop clients actually consume lesser data and run smoother. Yeah, because the way these remote desktop clients is by sending data about things that have changed on the screen. And since you are not minimizing and switching windows around that much, it ends up consuming less data than a regular 1080p monitor.\\n\\nThe color reproduction is great, covers the sRGB scale completely (as per official specs), which makes it great for use in Photography, Cinematography and design work. Note that I would not recommend a curved screen to people who work with straight lines (like AutoCAD, and other such kinds of design softwares and tools).\\n\\nSimply, a very clean and clear image, I do not see any uneven lighting or backlight bleeding on this display. The display angles are really good, and is extremely comfortable to use. No eye strain noticed either.\\n\\nPeak brightness is 300 Nits, which I\\'ve found more than adequate for use in my room. Most of the time during the day, I find myself using the screen at about 40-50% brightness, and at night I bring it down to 5-10% brightness.\\n\\nHDR\\n-------\\nThis is an 8-bit + FRC panel, and is not a true 10-bit HDR display. While it does support HDR, I haven\\'t had a chance to notice the difference as significantly, tried playing some HDR youtube videos, which look fantastic as it is, need to try some true 10-bit HDR videos. For some reason, Windows 10 shows me the display as HDR compatible when I\\'ve connected with USB-C but not when using the DisplayPort.

       " \"Before i start with the in depth review, let me state that this is actually the best 2k 144hz IPS monitor you can buy for 32k in India, And i would give it a 9/10.\\n\\nThose who wanna know more can continue reading.\\n\\nWe will divide the review in a few sections :\\n\\n1) Introduction and some background :\\n===============================\\nAcer's Nitro series is not their flagship series and as such they tend to omit some features and keep the advertisement and branding to a minimal for this range.\\n\\nNitro series is targeted towards more budget oriented gamers and till now they have done a good job at providing good peripherals for cheap.\\n\\nNow i am not trying to say that Nitro series can go toe to toe with their Predator series lineup, but fortunately for us gamers this time it seems like this particular monitor is actually a better product overall than the Predator XB271HU which costs around 50k.\\n\\n2) Picture Quality/Panel Quality :\\n==========================\\nThis monitor uses an IPS panel made by INNOLUX(OEM) which is also found in the much costlier Aorus AD27QD.\\nThe panel boasts of very high brightness in excess of 400 nits. It also boasts of a wide color gamut exceeding 95% DCI P3 coverage. Both of these things combined certify this monitor to carry the HDR400 moniker.\\n\\nThe monitor has a nominal response time of about 6-7 ms which is actually not the best for an IPS but gets the job done considering you need each frame delivered every 6-7 ms for a monitor to be able to display 144 frames per second. Along with being 144hz capable the monitor also comes equipped with Freesync and i am happy to report that GSYNC does work with this monitor. Freesync Range is limited to 48hz to 144hz so it also support LFC(Low Framerate Compensation), google it if you want to know more, it's quite an interesting feature to have :)\\n\\nSpecs aside, i think the monitor's color calibration out of the box is not that great but the OSD offers a lot of options to tweak color, gamma, brightness, contrast as well as hue and saturation of 6 basic colors, meaning you can calibrate it to your liking if need be without much hassle. Although it needs to be noted that the seeded SRGB emulation mode is quite restrictive and offers very little in the way of tweaking. So i advice against using that.\\n\\nI really enjoyed this display, the colors after a bit of tinkering are very well saturated and true to life, in fact the colors are much better here than on the Predator XB271HU which has a limited color gamut. The Contrast ratio too is above 1100:1 which is great for an IPS panel.\\n\\nThe monitor also supports Overdrive and backlight strobing and inserts a solid color frame in between pixel transitions to increase the pixel responsiveness substantially and the difference between using it without backlight strobing and with is quite apparent that if your eyes can take it, since the backlight strobing is a little hard on eyes. But having this feature is anyday better than not having it.\\n\\nIt's also crazy how good this panel is in terms of backlight bleed, i have attached a few pics showcasing that, and yes i know backlight bleed can vary from panel to panel, but researching a little bit over the internet and taking feedback from other owners, i can firmly conclude that this INNOLUX panel is much less prone to backlight bleed than the AU Optronics panel which is currently the most widely used 2k 144hz panel(Acer Predator, Asus ROG)\\n\\nPretty sure you guys can fathom by now that this monitor checks a lot of boxes :\\nFreesync/G SYNC compatible - Check\\nBarely any Backlight Bleed - Check\\nWide Color Gamut - Check\\nHigh Contrast and Brightness - Check\\nIPS panel - Check\\n144hz - Check\\nBacklight Strobing - Check\\nCan accept HDR input - Check\\nDon't have to sell a kidney to buy it - Check\\n\\n3) Build and Accessories:\\n====================\\nIt's surprisingly well built, and looks pretty similar to the Predator XB271HU with its slim to non existent bezels(Except at the bottom).\\n\\nTo control the OSD we have an intuitive joystick at the back which is a welcome change and makes navigating the OSD a breeze. Well talking about OSD reminds me of how many options it has for tweaking everything from brightness to freesync to colors, unfortunately describing each setting here is an exercise in futility, since all these details are available in their official documentation. So unless there is something out of the ordinary, i will not be bringing it up.\\n\\nThe stand accompanied with this monitor is probably the biggest sore point, it only offers minimal tilt and it's not a very pleasant experience, but considering the price i guess that's a necessary sacrifice, on the plus side though, you can go out and buy a quality VESA arm for 3-5k(Yes this monitor has VESA compatible mount at the back)\\n\\nLest i forget, it needs to be mentioned that G SYNC is only supported when using a Display Port cable and this monitor only comes with an HDMI cable, so folks with an NVIDIA GPU make sure you order a Display Port 1.4 cable along with it.\\n\\n4) Conclusion :\\n============\\nWell this is tricky, i have already proclaimed that this is the best monitor you can buy under 60k, while it only costs 32k, which means i am saying indirectly that this is better than any monitor under 60k, which should be taken with a pinch of salt. Let me explain :\\n\\nMonitors like Predator and ROG cost a lot more not just because they are the flagship offerings and they don't want to dilute their respective brands but also because they carry G SYNC modules and are certified by Nvidia, meaning they have best in class pixel response times and best in class input lag. While this VG271U has non existent input lag, it does have an average pixel response time and doesn't have the G SYNC module.\\n\\nFor some us these would be crucial but i think from a more critical perspective these are things which should not matter as much unless you are a Pro Gamer but even then i have to ask, how many pro gamers actually use a 2k monitor, because 2k is not an easy resolution to run, it requires beefy GPU to push those frames at 2k. And it is because of this i don't think the aforementioned drawbacks are a deal breaker for 90% of us and it's an acceptable sacrifice to get such a great monitor at 32k.\\n\\nHope i made myself clear, if not you are welcome to pose a question in the comments section.\\n\\n4) Misc. Stuff :\\n============\\n\\nIn this section i want to talk about 2 controversial topics, HDR400 and Flickering.\\nLet's start with flickering, as some users have reported flickering is a real issue with some of the panels, if you google you can see you are not alone and other users have had this issues as well, but there are 2 types of people reporting this flickering problem here and a clear distinction needs to be made :\\n\\nA. People having flickering out of the box while using Freesync : This is clearly a panel defect and you can ask Amazon or Acer to get a replacement, most users have this problem resolved after getting the replacement.\\n\\nB. People having flickering while using the freesync with nvidia cards(G SYNC) : This could be a defect and could also be due to the fact that this monitor is not officially in the Nvidia's G SYNC compatible list, So you would be lucky if the manufacturer provided you a replacement which works, but it is not something you can contest. Luckily for me my panel works very well with G SYNC and there is no flickering, your mileage may vary.\\n\\nIf your panel is within the amazon's replacement period, i suggest you go for it.\\n\\nNow let's talk about HDR400, most of you must be aware that without any form of local dimming, you cannot really boost the contrast ratio which is critical for a good HDR experience and that's also the reason why good HDR TV's and monitors are so costly, as they have to implement multi-zone backlight systems which are quite expensive. While this monitor does come with HDR400 certification , the certification itself is somewhat pointless since the HDR400 standard is pretty weak. It is not to say that HDR400 doesn't improve image quality for HDR enabled content, but all i am trying to say is keep your expectations in check, the best this monitor will do is crank the brightness to 400+ nits and provide better colors while using HDR mode, the main advantage here is getting better colors but not a better HDR experience which heavily relies on super high Contrast Ratio.\\n\\nThat's it folks, not sure if i missed anything, but for now this concludes my review.\",\n",

Stuff :\\n============\\n\\nIn this section i want to talk about 2 controversial topics, HDR400 and Flickering.\\nLet's start with flickering, as some users have reported flickering is a real issue with some of the panels, if you google you can see you are not alone and other users have had this issues as well, but there are 2 types of people reporting this flickering problem here and a clear distinction needs to be made :\\n\\nA. People having flickering out of the box while using Freesync : This is clearly a panel defect and you can ask Amazon or Acer to get a replacement, most users have this problem resolved after getting the replacement.\\n\\nB. People having flickering while using the freesync with nvidia cards(G SYNC) : This could be a defect and could also be due to the fact that this monitor is not officially in the Nvidia's G SYNC compatible list, So you would be lucky if the manufacturer provided you a replacement which works, but it is not something you can contest. Luckily for me my panel works very well with G SYNC and there is no flickering, your mileage may vary.\\n\\nIf your panel is within the amazon's replacement period, i suggest you go for it.\\n\\nNow let's talk about HDR400, most of you must be aware that without any form of local dimming, you cannot really boost the contrast ratio which is critical for a good HDR experience and that's also the reason why good HDR TV's and monitors are so costly, as they have to implement multi-zone backlight systems which are quite expensive. While this monitor does come with HDR400 certification , the certification itself is somewhat pointless since the HDR400 standard is pretty weak. It is not to say that HDR400 doesn't improve image quality for HDR enabled content, but all i am trying to say is keep your expectations in check, the best this monitor will do is crank the brightness to 400+ nits and provide better colors while using HDR mode, the main advantage here is getting better colors but not a better HDR experience which heavily relies on super high Contrast Ratio.\\n\\nThat's it folks, not sure if i missed anything, but for now this concludes my review.\",\n",
       " \"Before i start with the in depth review, let me state that this is actually the best 2k 144hz IPS monitor you can buy for 32k in India, And i would give it a 9/10.\\n\\nThose who wanna know more can continue reading.\\n\\nWe will divide the review in a few sections :\\n\\n1) Introduction and some background :\\n===============================\\nAcer's Nitro series is not their flagship series and as such they tend to omit some features and keep the advertisement and branding to a minimal for this range.\\n\\nNitro series is targeted towards more budget oriented gamers and till now they have done a good job at providing good peripherals for cheap.\\n\\nNow i am not trying to say that Nitro series can go toe to toe with their Predator series lineup, but fortunately for us gamers this time it seems like this particular monitor is actually a better product overall than the Predator XB271HU which costs around 50k.\\n\\n2) Picture Quality/Panel Quality :\\n==========================\\nThis monitor uses an IPS panel made by INNOLUX(OEM) which is also found in the much costlier Aorus AD27QD.\\nThe panel boasts of very high brightness in excess of 400 nits. It also boasts of a wide color gamut exceeding 95% DCI P3 coverage. Both of these things combined certify this monitor to carry the HDR400 moniker.\\n\\nThe monitor has a nominal response time of about 6-7 ms which is actually not the best for an IPS but gets the job done considering you need each frame delivered every 6-7 ms for a monitor to be able to display 144 frames per second. Along with being 144hz capable the monitor also comes equipped with Freesync and i am happy to report that GSYNC does work with this monitor. Freesync Range is limited to 48hz to 144hz so it also support LFC(Low Framerate Compensation), google it if you want to know more, it's quite an interesting feature to have :)\\n\\nSpecs aside, i think the monitor's color calibration out of the box is not that great but the OSD offers a lot of options to tweak color, gamma, brightness, contrast as well as hue and saturation of 6 basic colors, meaning you can calibrate it to your liking if need be without much hassle. Although it needs to be noted that the seeded SRGB emulation mode is quite restrictive and offers very little in the way of tweaking. So i advice against using that.\\n\\nI really enjoyed this display, the colors after a bit of tinkering are very well saturated and true to life, in fact the colors are much better here than on the Predator XB271HU which has a limited color gamut. The Contrast ratio too is above 1100:1 which is great for an IPS panel.\\n\\nThe monitor also supports Overdrive and backlight strobing and inserts a solid color frame in between pixel transitions to increase the pixel responsiveness substantially and the difference between using it without backlight strobing and with is quite apparent that if your eyes can take it, since the backlight strobing is a little hard on eyes.

TV + Monitor all in one interface, pre loaded with the YouTube/Prime/Netflix/Hotstar/Zee5/Apple TV+ apps.\\n\\n2. Display & visual calibration - Despite being a VGA panel, I\\'ve zero complaints on the display quality and the available calibration options. I haven\\'t witnessed any ghosting/black bleeding regardless of the surrounding brightness. Eye Care & Adaptive Display calibration are good & I\\'m sure with the subsequent software updates, display options and calibrations will only grow from strength to strength.\\n\\n3. Seamless transition from Tv to Work & back : Thanks to the Tizen OS. All it takes is just a remote click and I\\'m already loving to swap between the TV & the Work Monitor without much ado or efforts.\\n\\n4. Remote - The best part of it all. Minimalistic yet effective. This makes the experience so rewarding. Offers the comfort from wherever you are.\\n\\n5. Audio quality - Oh boy, this blew me off! Nobody would\\'ve expected a monitor to perform so well in this area. The Amplification option is \"real loud\" and trust me you won\\'t need to tune beyond 25 so not to invite the fury of your neighbours. Audio quality is exceptionally good given its price range. Hey but, don\\'t expect the Atmos / Bass effect. It does it\\'s job over and above. DOT. It even allows you to pair a bluetooth headset/speaker if in case you need. The BT headphone option for sure helps those late night binge watchers with parents/kids next room.\\n\\n6. AirPlay support - Perhaps the only non mac monitor to come up with an inbuilt AirPlay support. You can mirror your iOS / MacOs / iPadOs devices with an one time pairing. Works reasonably good although the efficacy lies in the strength of your Wifi.\\nBut make no mistake, the monitor doesn’t support HomePods / HomePods Mini yet for Audio streaming. I wish they enabled this feature. This monitor and HomePods for audio would’ve summed up a quality entertainment.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Meh? 😼\\n\\n1. Tizen/Samsung App Store is still evolving and you won\\'t find a lot of Indian OTT/News apps in there yet. But all the major ones mentioned above are already available.\\n\\n2. Bixby Voice assistant is still mediocre.\\n\\n3. Not for ardent gamers. Screen refresh rate tanks at 60Hz.\\n\\n4. No Ethernet port making it entirely relying on Wifi. So unless you’ve a strong Wifi, you can’t leverage the Tv features much.\\n\\n5. Wireless screen mirroring has a lag and that’s understandable. However the wireless mirroring supports only the screen refresh rate of 30 Hz against the capable 60 Hz. As well the screen resolution is supported only at 720P / 1080P against the 4K.',\n",

But watching movies and playing game is only requirement then you can prefer 27 inch model as well.\\nOverall, I am quite happy with the monitor and you can blindly choose this.\",\n",
       " \"I have been using this monitor for almost A YEAR now. Bought it for 15300/- back then.\\n\\nPicture quality is good, great brightness and colour calibration but the build quality is not. The edges of the glass panel are not smooth and seamless You will notice it as soon as you sit in front. The plastic protective bezel around the glass display is of really cheap quality and paint has started to chip. Pixel pitch is okay (about 116 I think) if you use this monitor from a 2 feet of distance. NOT recommended for MacOS, fonts look really bad.\\n\\nSome people have told me this monitor costs a little extra for the special colour calibration from the factory which is nice but shouldn't that be a factory standard for all monitors anyways?\\n\\nPower on-off + controls switch ( It's a joystick actually ) has a built-in white light which you can set to remain off or on. It serves as a keyboard light in dark rooms which I think is a brilliant idea!\\n\\nSpeakers are just bad, so bad that they don't even deserve a review.\\n\\n2HDMI, 1 VGA, 1 Line-in, 1 Headphone. Ports are alright but in horizontal position so if you plugin 2 cables side-by-size there is barely any space between them.\\n\\nStand looks nice, cheap quality plastic again. Has a recycled kind of metal bar hidden underneath, attached for weight and stability. There is NO HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT and just a small amount of tilt. There is NO WOBBLE like everyone around here has been complaining, you guys need a sturdy table 😋\\n\\nMonitor comes with a control utility which you need to download from LG's website. It's okay and allows you use monitor in different modes. But I think 23.8 inch isn't that big enough for effective use of those features.\\n\\nOther brands with similar or even bigger size of monitors are much much cheaper with same or better performance.\\n\\nOh one major issue if you are hoping to use the VESA mount. The VESA screw ports are way up the monitor edge so if you mount it along side any other monitor this one will sit really low.

I tried all settings and combinations in monitor and through graphics settings but failed to achieve a similar looking display.\\n\\nThe blacks on these are like grey and there is no backlight bleeding but screen is giving out an even whitish light even on low brightness. Changing contrast doesn't do anything much due to which colors looks washed out sometimes but details on high resolution videos are better.\\n\\nThere are no pixalations, colors looks natural but again deep blacks are no where to be found.

Looking at this display and then my laptop's to and fro continuously was straining my eyes badly.\\n\\nNow I got HP 22es and after smalls changes it easily looks like my laptop's display and a true extension with deeper blacks. So I suggest buying this monitor for standalone use (where you don't have to compare and just enjoy the high res natural colors this display has to offer) or if you have similar VA panel from before.

I don't think I would ever be going back to using a monitor with a plastic stand after using this one.\\n\\n-Good Picture quality:\\nOut of the box the blue shade was a little bit more than it usually should be, but after calibration this was comparable to panels from LG or Benq. For comparison I am using a LG 27MP59G along side this and the picture quality from Zebronics panel is almost the same.\\nI didn't face any issues while playing games on this but still I would not recommend this monitor if you want to play a competitive fighting game like street fighter or tekken on this.\\n\\n-Thin Bezels:\\nThe bezels are actully really thin. While the physical bezels seem to be paper thin, the actual LED and the outsides of the monitor make the bezel about 0.8cm which is great.\\n\\n-Budget friendly:\\nThere are not many monitors that offer thin bezel, great picture quality and viewing angles along with the 27inch screen size at this price point.

The IPS bleed is horrible. It is visible on all corners. Even if you decide to ignore them, there is even more crazier issues. There is no fluedity in videos, even if you are watching 1080p video at 60fps, there is visibke stuttering. Cant even watch hdr content online. Terrible for gaming as well due to stuttering.',\n",

Rtings.com also found the same.\\n4. Vignetting effect - The horrendous amount of IPS glow creates a vignetting effect. Pixels farther away from the screen appears dim.\\n5. Non-uniform brightness - The brightness is not uniform everywhere on the screen. This is also related to the vignetting effect.\\n6. There were two dead pixels that I could find.

Dark mode is typically bad on VA monitors because of the high contrast ratio of VA panels that makes the text look like floating on ink.

Truly 178 degree horizontal and vertical, many people can see.\\n-- Important Connections : Display Port 1.2, HDMI 1.4 , Audio Out Jax (good thing they didnt waste money on waste speakers like rest), so you can make it a TV with added speakers using HDMI and Audio Jack.\\n-- Actual response time is 5ms, which is decent for an IPS panel.\\n-- FREE SYNC! Trust me, MUCH better than Vsync of even best GTX1080ti! (only Gsync could match it), Say good bye to screen tearing. And hopefully AMD FREE SYNC will get NVIDIA off their high horses huh... I aint AMD fanboy, but we really wish fair competition instead of Evil Monopoly!\\n-- And hey, brightness was surprising all right! i thought this 250 nits will be much lesser than 300 Nits i was used to on laptop and old LG19inch but 250 nits is well spread, screen bleeding is minimal)\\n-- A lot of Controls! Yeup, i like being able to totally customize every aspect, and this monitor gives you A Lot of options! (even 2 3 4 screens on same! Although the control button is like Old Nokia mobile 4 way stick, but so far so good...)\\n-- And it does work at 75hz! (unlike what other ppl claim thats only FreeSync feature for AMD), i used on GTX1050ti OC.\\n-- Balanced pricing for features it offers.\\nCons:\\n-- ALAS! The Color Accuracy, contrast is NOT As good as i imagined... duh, my biggest and only disappointment i guess, my old LG19 Inch Flatron has better color! huh, i wasnt hoping this from IPS panel which boasts 72% on Adobe, and same on Color Gamut... Its not bad but just not great, so lets hope, i can get some color calibration so that it becomes as good as it boasts!\\n-- Lack of Tilting or Twisting\\n-- No VESA support or Height Adjustment (atleast VESA MUST be there, then you can mount on stand and adjust), i took this as known compromise, still if you have worked on height adjustment, you will miss it.\\n-- AND REMEMBER! If you go to 1080p from 720 or even 900p, then you MUST have stronger CPU and GPU! Or else, screen Tearing etc will be unbearable!\\n-- And 1ms Motion Blurr is arrant nonsense! Trust me, you are much better without it!\\nAnd other things like Power Consumption etc are normal for IPS Monitors at this price range.\\nAnd btw, i got from Appario, the product was nicely double packed!

Initially it was just1 vertical column, then two LED columns went bad. Can be seen in the latest/last pic that I have put . This monitor has got quality issues. I did not expect this kinda quality issues from a reputed brand like Lenovo. Totally unhappy. I'm now searching for the warranty claim procedure. Do not recommend this monitor due to quality issues.\\n\\nEdit : I've been trying to get in touch with the lenovo support guys to claim this warranty, but in vain. They have support only for corporate products, but nothing for normal consumer products. Its easier to contact the presidents office than be able to get in touch with lenovo customer support. MOst of the support numbers listed are obsolete . Even after you get in touch with their customer support, there is no means of tracking the status or progress of your issue/ticket. Feeling helpless and frustrated.\\n\\nEdit : After multiple frustrating calls, emails and regular follow up with the Lenovo support centre for about 20+ days, I finally received a replacement monitor . Will have to see if this one shows any defects in the next few months. Keeping my fingers crossed.\\n\\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MONITOR DUE TO SERIOUS QUALITY ISSUES.\\n\\nI bought the Lenovo Q27-q10 after a lot of research. I wanted to upgrade to a 27” monitor and I was in a dilemma if I should go for a 1080p or 1440p monitor. Going for this QHD ( 2560x1440 ) monitor was a great choice. This resolution offers great screen space, with a lot more content visible at once.\\nComing to the monitor, below are my observations:\\nPro’s :\\n1. The monitor is very thin and lightweight, but study enough. Stand is also robust and does not shake like some other models. The stand is a bit deep, so gives you space to tuck in your keyboard when not in use.\\n2. Colours are crisp and deep and vivid ( though its only 8 bit colour ). 2k videos look very good and vivid when viewed on this monitor. Haven’t played any games ( I’m not a gamer) so cannot comment on the response time and refresh rate.\\n3. The volume on the speakers, though not loud, is decent and can be used to watch some entertainment without the need for additional/external speakers.\\n4. Antiglare coating is good and very useful. Can watch movies comfortable even when there are lights behind you due to this antiglare coating.\\n\\nCons :\\n1. The height of the monitor is not adjustable. Only tilt can be adjusted. The height at which the lower bezel starts is a bit high, making the top of the monitor go a bit above your eye level. Having the top of the monitor exactly at your eye level is recommended for good ergonomics.\\n2. Though the bezel is thin, the screen image does not extend to the very edges of the bezel as is deceptively shown in the video or the pics in the site. There is actually some gap between the end of the screen and the bezel, as can be seen in one of my pic.\\n3. For some strange reason, volume control of the monitor is not possible from your Macbook. You get the controls on the laptop when you connect a Windows machine, but not in the Mac. So Mac users will have to adjust with constant volume or control the volume via the buttons.\\n4. The cable management system that is provides is utterly useless.\\n\\nOverall it’s a good buy if you are looking for a budget QHD monitor. Satisfied with the monitor.\",\n",

Who is culprit here ? How come wrongly written on box as well as in description that power cable is included ? Who is cheating here ? Actually I wanted to return this product as ther is no power cable in the box received.\\nLenovo /distributor/seller has to take care these things going ahead else confidence level as well as reputation of the brand goes down',\n",

       " \"This review is for the 28 inch 4k CB282K. Been using it for 2 days so far and its a reeeeallly good display. Blacks are as deep as you can expect from an IPS display - very minimal backlight bleed (unnoticeable 99% of the time) and excellent colour accuracy all around. It came supplied with a colour calibration data from the factory with delta E less than 2 but they failed to mention what mode (sRGB? USER? Standard?) mode they calibrate under. Even without custom calibration with a Spyder or a Colormunki the colours are to the T when compared with my other calibrated monitor. sRGB does look a bit off though - slightly washed out and oversaturated.

You might say that there are other 4K monitors in the 25k price range, but all those 28inch 4k panels are 4-year-old panels, and that too TN panels, that is the reason for their lower price. Those were one of the first 4k panels in the world, and their color quality was terrible. The only good thing about them was that they were 4k, but what is the point of it if a full HD 22-inch monitor beat it in terms of picture quality.\\n\\nThis Acer monitor has a 4k VA panel. Some of you might think VA is not good, but that is not at all true. VA has the best contrast ratio which is around 3000:1 while IPS and TN have it less than 1000:1. This matters a lot in terms of picture quality. Pictures in VA will look richer while IPS will look washed out if you compare them side to side. VA is excellent for viewing photos, watching movies, general computer tasks etc. Its viewing angles and colors are also significantly better than TN but not as good as IPS in those two categories.\\n\\nAll good LED TVs(except OLED) are VA panels for this reason. Have you heard of the Samsung Quantum Dot LED panel? That is a VA panel for example.\\n\\nThis high contrast ratio also means that you will be able to use it in darker environments without making the blacks look like dark grey. Also, IPS panels have poor quality control and thus backlight bleed are common, but not so with VA panels.\\n\\nAnother thing is that 4k at any lower screen size will mean you will surely have to deal with the problems of windows scaling which may not be required for a 32inch screen.',\n",

       " 'I was on the lookout for this monitor since I saw Hardware Unboxed review and they were very impressed by its performance. Its one of the fastest IPS panels having lower overshoot similar to LG Nano IPS but with better contrast ratio. Out of the box the colors pop out. Some people may not like the oversaturated colors but I like this vibrance. There is a new firmware with a sRGB clamp, but I don\\'t want to take a risk if that ruins the color vibrance I have now. There is a software OSD and you can control monitor settings without touching the monitor.\\n\\nHDR is fine - what you can get with 350 nits of max brightness - for me its not as \"bad\" as some people make it out to be. I could see more vibrance in youtube HDR videos. I mean you don\\'t need 1000 nits when you are sitting so close to the display - your eyes will complain.\\n\\nThe price MSI has fixed for it in India is ridiculous compared to what it retails for in the US. I got a good discount in the recent festival campaign Amazon is running. I got it because, to be honest, there isn\\'t any other monitor around compared to this one. I got a Samsung G7 32\" a few months back and oh man even though it is a very fast VA panel, Samsung completely messed up Gsync with its firmware, also it had some color artefacts like some smearing I could still see even though people deny it. I concluded that VA technology is not ready for adaptive sync.\\n\\nSo went in for this one. To my surprise the black level uniformity is quite good compared to other IPS panels I have owned. Back light bleed is almost non existent. The first panel I got had one small dead pixel on top left. Amazon was kind enough to offer me a replacement and the second unit has no issues so far - touch wood.\\n\\nThe only other gripe I have is MSI put a Display Port version 1.2a, not 1.4. This limits 10 bit RGB at 1440p to 120 Hz. Above this refresh rate you have to drop the color depth to 8 bits. Not that we can notice the difference anyway :-)',\n",

The width could be fooling because the height is very very less and overall looks very small, smaller than a 19\" monitor which is a deal breaker for me. I couldnt return the product because Amazon didnt provide the return option and only can replace it, thats very disappointing. The clarity is amazing and the adjustments are great. People who do video editing will like the Ultra wide feature and the look and feel is great. But the size of the monitor is deceiving and its not for those who want a bigger monitor. Barring the size, its really wide and will be very helpful for those who need a wider screen. Other limitation is it doesnt have a VGA port and has only HDMI. Its Full HD and IPS which provides great clarity and ruggedness. Doesnt have inbuilt speakers..the wide looks feels cool..but size is something who should physically see before buying..seriously!. Great for those who love video editing, gaming. You will also see all other monitors as narrower after seeing this monitor. Could have been nice if the height is little greater.',\n",

       " \"LG has outdone themselves with the 27GL850 monitor. Although I had my eye on this specific model for a while now, I expected the pricing in India to be atrocious. However, I managed to snag one for way lower than I had anticipated. Very well worth the money spent!\\nNow, on to the monitor itself.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPros:\\n- Brilliant, vibrant colors.\\n- Excellent Color Gamut (you'll have to calibrate if you're working with color-sensitive content creation)\\n- Very wide viewing angles\\n- Ultra-low response times (well, mostly. See cons for more details). Thanks to LG's Nano IPS tech.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Advertised 1ms response time ('faster' mode) is quite useless as the overshoot is horrible. You'll be plagued by ghosting and inverse ghosting in fast-paced games. Bringing the response time down to 'fast' fixes these issues and doesn't result in too much of a response time penalty (drops to 4ms, which is still excellent for an IPS panel).\\n- The blacks on this monitor are sub-par. There's some bleed on the edges, and the blacks aren't as deep as I'm used to (coming from a Samsung QDot VA panel that had lovely blacks). But this doesn't mar the gaming experience one bit. If you're coming from anything other than a quality VA panel, you won't be disappointed.\\n- HDR, sadly, is a gimmick on this panel. The HDR mode manages to look worse than the standard modes with some content, and it hasn't even qualified the measly HDR400 certification. Leave this off, and stay away from this monitor if HDR factors into your purchase decision. However, at this price, I really can't complain.\\n\\nTakeaways:\\nDon't use the marketed '1ms' response time mode. Set it to the 'Fast' mode and still enjoy a very snappy experience in all your games.\\nPlease CALIBRATE your monitor. The factory calibration was quite terrible, and after a bit of tweaking, there was a significant improvement.\\nAll in all, a very close-to-perfect monitor at this price range.

Brightness is good but that does not matter, because what is the point of it. This is the reason why it is not good for watching movies in night.\\nFor gamers its is good. Take Care.\",\n",

       " \"Hey gamers, this Asus vg248qe is for you folks. If anyone wanting this for editing or office work please refrain from buying this. I'm saying this because such work doesn't require 144hz ref rate and 1ms response time. Aur fir aankhein bhi kharab karoge 😆\\nIt's a true gaming monitor with great features like realtime crosshair placement in games. 1ms response time is super and 144hz gives you smooth mouse movement.\\nRemember, if you buying this, your GPU should be capable of giving the same render rate like upto 100 or 144hz render rate to your monitor. Otherwise no matter you set it at 144 or 100hz. If you are using 1050ti , it doesn't going to give you a smooth performance. Because in latest games the GPU won't push above 65hz render rate that matches the monitor's ref rate and chances are you will encounter with image tearing and lag.\\nIf you are planning to upgrade your card to 1060 6gb or above, this monitor gives you mindblowing performance and smoothness.\\n\\nFor the cons, the screen has too much brightness so I recommend you not using it for heavy hours, give your eyes some rest in between.\\n\\nYou can also change color modes in it, has almost 6 diff color modes Osd has good options to set the monitor's colors and contrast as per your taste.\\nBulit quality is solid, the back bracket for cable management is quite worthy.\\n\\nThe monitor is height adjutable and tiltable to certain degree, yoy should avoid monitors those do not have heigh adjustable function. Just because most of the gaming monitors have TN panels and so it's necessary to adjust them as per your eye level so that you can avoid washing out colors.\\n\\nYou can rotate it to 45 degree left and right.\\nSo it's all from my point of view friends, have queations? Shoot a message me here and I would love to answer you. Like the review? Give me a thumbs up and 😻 like 👍\",\n",
