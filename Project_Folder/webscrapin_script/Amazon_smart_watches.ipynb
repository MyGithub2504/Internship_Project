App is too below par.\\n\\nDecide for yourself, if look, screen quality, touch responsibility is mostly what you are looking for you may go for it. Else i wont recommend.\\n\\nAnother huge point. It was cheaper by just a bit more than 1200 rupees while i had bought (Mar 19, 2021 was the deliver date) it, on Flipkart. Even if you choose to buy this please remember to compare amonst all the good e-comms.',\n",

In my picture you can see the sleep display is merged with calories. Wake by lift wrist feature is not accurate, it does not work while you are sleeping.\\n3 - Attached in picture, if in your contacts some name is greater than 15 characters of string then when they call or msg their name will be blurred out as shown. So you need to cut down their name to get it notified.\\n4 - Very difficult to update the firmware as the software is filled with bugs, as you can see my watch was almost full charge still its not allowing to upgrade the firmware, saying battery has to be more than 30% of charge, again had to reset reinstall and repair.\\n5 - App keeps on crashing, so again reset reinstall and re pair.\\n6 - Not tested on android but the app heats and burn the ios when you sync the watch or apply watch faces, making the phone very hot.\\n7 - Their world clock timezones arrangement is not good, very difficult to fine us timezones and most of the central timezones are missing!\\n8 - Poor quality strap, had to use third party straps and touch lags like anything.\\n9 - No continuous spo2 monitoring and find my phone doesn’t work half of the times!\\n10 - Battery life is not upto mark as advertised.\\n\\nHonest feedback:\\n\\nNoise is only trying to copy aple smart watch from looks to accessories to watch faces, while doing that they have not done any kind of quality test or UAT.\\n\\nPlease do not fall for any positive reviews on utube as most of them are paid sponsored!\\n\\nI got frustrated and switched to Huwaei band 6, please go for that, no issues so far and runs like a butter.\\n\\nAlso as customer i dont want to buy a watch and then give that company all the sweet time to fix their issues, they should do air tight testing before selling something in the market!\\n\\nRegulators should check these kind of products as I felt cheated by purchasing this watch!\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nNoise customer support has reached out to me and they have agreed that they have bugs so gave me their complaint link PFB:\\n\\n“sir actually watch is fine but we are working on an app so that why you are facing the problem sir really sorry for that and we are trying to share you a new update of the app”\\n\\nAnd amazon has also replaced my watch but again almost same issues! :(\\n\\nSo guys noise as a brand is here to do false advertisement then take away customer’s money and invest in their new product there by leaving us here with this junkyard type product.\\n\\nAs a tech enthusiast all I can say, Please go for alternatives like huawei, mi, amazefit.

Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.\\n◾ Battery life of 7 to 10 days.\\n◾ IPX68 dust and waterproof.\\n◾ Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring\\n◾ Better control & display of calls, messages and music from the band\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n♻️ WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n◾ More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.\\n◾ Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.\\n\\n-------------------\\n🍱 OVERALL\\n-------------------\\nThe MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. 🥇\",\n",
       " \"Original 3rd Jan 2021: This is my first smartwatch. I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family, but this is my personal first. I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and I'm aware of most of the products in the budget range. While I can afford a slightly more expensive one (GTS2/GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro, Oppo Watch, Fitbit etc) with calling feature, I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first. I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa (yet to be included, but must be available through an OTA update). I'd have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display (has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro). It still isn't released in India.\\nComing to the watch's performance, the typical features I tried today (first day) are Heart RATE (HR), SPO2, Stress monitoring and GPS. I have a pulse oximeter from Dr. Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2. The numbers on the watch aren't very accurate to my surprise (heart rate variation by 5-10 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10% points at times) . But I still feel it's more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc. GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house. It won't surprise me if I don't get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc. The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone. Music controls worked fine, bluetooth data transfer or sync was good. I couldn't control the phone camera as I couldn't get that feature to work (refer to image and help me if you can). I didn't face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications. The readability on the watch screen has been really good. Tried a couple of workouts. While the step count seems to be fine, not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes.\\nTo conclude, I wouldn't say that this watch is a disappointment, but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats. Probably I should give it more time, but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy (at least the Honor bands I've seen). Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as I'm curious what all it can do.\\nI would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days. Let's see.\\nUpdate (8th Jan 2021): The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out. I'm hardly getting it for 3.5 days with always on display and an occasional workout. Limited watch faces, both on device (4) and the app (57). Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display. Waterproof nature of the device is good. I didn't dip it in water, but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action. I got the camera shutter to work. I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa. Notifications didn't have an issue, but could not clear individual items (clear all worked)\",\n",

The policy of Amazfit that if there is a product fault I need to get in touch with there service centre so that they will arrange a pickup from my home. Now here I would like to mention few points.\\n1. Getting in touch with the executive is very hard over call as every time the line gets Disconnected automatically after a couple of ring.\\n2. I was able to talk to one of there executive after a days try. He gave me a phone no. And I need to share the photo of my invoice in that no. Then I will get a link which I need to fill to get my product picked up. The executive also mentioned a person from blue dart courier will come to pick up and I need to save his contact no\\n3. I send the photo of that invoice immediately but there were no response. And nearly after 48 hours I got that link from that no. So I filled it up immediately and again I was waiting patiently. Meanwhile I understood that I have to go again a long waiting period as definitely the urgency was from my side not from Amazfit.\\n4. Again a couple of days passed while I got a call from blue dart asking my pincode which is 700129. And out of my misery he told me. My pincode is unserviceable, which I have heard for the first time as I am ordering prducts online and every now and then I am getting them delivered through Bluedart, DTDC, ECart, Delhivery. I requested that person badly and got the reply that he will try.\\n5. Again a couple of days passed by but there were no response from that person. So I tried to contact Amazfit customer care for the entire day yesterday but as usual there were no rebsonse. And finally after trying N number of times I talked to someone again today sometime back at the time of writing this review. And the response I got from him is this is not there's fault but the fault of blue dart. I pleed to him to understand my pain point for once so he told me that he will get back to me and disconnected on my face right away without listening any further.\\nI don't know what should be the next step. I am quite not sure this writing will help or not even will anyone read this long review but I can definitely say this is the WROST PRODUCT AND SERVICE EXPERIENCE that I am having after buying AMAZFIT GTR2\",\n",

       " \"Original 3rd Jan 2021: This is my first smartwatch. I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family, but this is my personal first. I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and I'm aware of most of the products in the budget range. While I can afford a slightly more expensive one (GTS2/GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro, Oppo Watch, Fitbit etc) with calling feature, I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first. I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa (yet to be included, but must be available through an OTA update). I'd have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display (has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro). It still isn't released in India.\\nComing to the watch's performance, the typical features I tried today (first day) are Heart RATE (HR), SPO2, Stress monitoring and GPS. I have a pulse oximeter from Dr. Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2. The numbers on the watch aren't very accurate to my surprise (heart rate variation by 5-10 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10% points at times) . But I still feel it's more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc. GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house. It won't surprise me if I don't get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc. The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone. Music controls worked fine, bluetooth data transfer or sync was good. I couldn't control the phone camera as I couldn't get that feature to work (refer to image and help me if you can). I didn't face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications. The readability on the watch screen has been really good. Tried a couple of workouts. While the step count seems to be fine, not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes.\\nTo conclude, I wouldn't say that this watch is a disappointment, but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats. Probably I should give it more time, but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy (at least the Honor bands I've seen). Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as I'm curious what all it can do.\\nI would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days. Let's see.\\nUpdate (8th Jan 2021): The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out. I'm hardly getting it for 3.5 days with always on display and an occasional workout. Limited watch faces, both on device (4) and the app (57). Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display. Waterproof nature of the device is good. I didn't dip it in water, but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action. I got the camera shutter to work. I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa. Notifications didn't have an issue, but could not clear individual items (clear all worked)\",\n",

       " 'The watch looks very nice, but that\\'s its best feature. Tracking so far looks to be pretty good. GPS is so-so, not very precise, but usable.\\nThe main problems is that despite the Bluetooth 5 this watch loses the connection with a phone very easily. I can be just 4 meters from the phone, which is in another room, but just around the corner from the door, and the watch loses the connection all the time. You literally have to have your phone within several meters from you and be in the same room if you want to get your phone notifications on your watch.\\nFor comparison, the cheap budget Honor Band 5 that I also have doesn\\'t lose Bluetooth connection even when 15m or 2 rooms away from the phone.\\nThe vibration motor is weaker when compared to the much smaller Honor band, even when set on an Enhanced setting. I can\\'t rely on the alarm of this watch to wake me up with its weak vibration. The top of the watch vibrates more than the bottom that\\'s in contact with the arm. It looks like the internal position of the vibration motor wasn\\'t well thought out.\\nThe watch also doesn\\'t respond properly to \"raise to wake\" (even when sensitivity is set to high). Often it doesn\\'t turn on when I raise my hand. I have to raise it very high for display to turn on. But, on the other hand, it goes on constantly when I\\'m washing my hands, as my hands move, which it shouldn\\'t. After a few days it becomes frustrating, so you have to turn on the always on display (which is very good), but the battery will go down to 4 days, max 5 if you use it lightly.\\n\\nThe notification system is not very good - some message notifications like from Whatsapp will come as \"3 messages from 2 chats\", \"5 messages from 3 chats\", without the possibility to see the individual messages. That\\'s pretty dumb for a smart watch... The cheap Honor band shows individual notifications just fine, and it\\'s always a bit faster to show a notification. But you do have a much bigger display than on a band...\\n\\nBesides the heart and sleep tracking, which look pretty accurate, the watch can track your energy and stress levels, supposedly based on the HRV algorithms. I\\'m not sure they really correspond to the experience how I feel, but you can track it and try to improve your wellbeing.\\nThe step counting isn\\'t very accurate. I did a few tests where I myself counted the steps, and the watch counted on average 6-7% more steps than I did, whereas the Honor band counted around 1% more.\\n\\nOverall, if you want to use this watch ONLY for workout and wellbeing tracking (and keep in mind that the watch can track ONLY 10 most basic workouts!) then it\\'s an OK option. It has some advanced algorithms for tracking the energy and stress, besides the sleep and HR (no SpO2 blood oxygen tracking though). But, to be honest, you can do the same workout tracking with 4-5 times cheaper smart bands like Honor or Mi bands... It\\'s a more advanced band with a big screen that looks very nice, and can also show more details on the watch itself, without needing to look into the app.\\nBut, if you want to use this watch as a smart watch (and you would probably want because of its large screen and good looks) then I don\\'t think it\\'s worth its price. It\\'s almost less functional and less smart for notifications than 4-5 times cheaper smart bands, and it doesn\\'t have a mic and a speaker for bluetooth calling like some other smart watches in this price category. The weak Bluetooth connection and vibration motor make it less practical as well to use it as a smart watch.\\nI can\\'t recommend it.',\n",

It\\'s a more advanced band with a big screen that looks very nice, and can also show more details on the watch itself, without needing to look into the app.\\nBut, if you want to use this watch as a smart watch (and you would probably want because of its large screen and good looks) then I don\\'t think it\\'s worth its price. It\\'s almost less functional and less smart for notifications than 4-5 times cheaper smart bands, and it doesn\\'t have a mic and a speaker for bluetooth calling like some other smart watches in this price category. The weak Bluetooth connection and vibration motor make it less practical as well to use it as a smart watch.\\nI can\\'t recommend it.',\n",
       " 'The watch looks very nice, but that\\'s its best feature. Tracking so far looks to be pretty good. GPS is so-so, not very precise, but usable.\\nThe main problems is that despite the Bluetooth 5 this watch loses the connection with a phone very easily. I can be just 4 meters from the phone, which is in another room, but just around the corner from the door, and the watch loses the connection all the time. You literally have to have your phone within several meters from you and be in the same room if you want to get your phone notifications on your watch.\\nFor comparison, the cheap budget Honor Band 5 that I also have doesn\\'t lose Bluetooth connection even when 15m or 2 rooms away from the phone.\\nThe vibration motor is weaker when compared to the much smaller Honor band, even when set on an Enhanced setting. I can\\'t rely on the alarm of this watch to wake me up with its weak vibration. The top of the watch vibrates more than the bottom that\\'s in contact with the arm. It looks like the internal position of the vibration motor wasn\\'t well thought out.\\nThe watch also doesn\\'t respond properly to \"raise to wake\" (even when sensitivity is set to high). Often it doesn\\'t turn on when I raise my hand. I have to raise it very high for display to turn on. But, on the other hand, it goes on constantly when I\\'m washing my hands, as my hands move, which it shouldn\\'t. After a few days it becomes frustrating, so you have to turn on the always on display (which is very good), but the battery will go down to 4 days, max 5 if you use it lightly.\\n\\nThe notification system is not very good - some message notifications like from Whatsapp will come as \"3 messages from 2 chats\", \"5 messages from 3 chats\", without the possibility to see the individual messages. That\\'s pretty dumb for a smart watch... The cheap Honor band shows individual notifications just fine, and it\\'s always a bit faster to show a notification. But you do have a much bigger display than on a band...\\n\\nBesides the heart and sleep tracking, which look pretty accurate, the watch can track your energy and stress levels, supposedly based on the HRV algorithms. I\\'m not sure they really correspond to the experience how I feel, but you can track it and try to improve your wellbeing.\\nThe step counting isn\\'t very accurate. I did a few tests where I myself counted the steps, and the watch counted on average 6-7% more steps than I did, whereas the Honor band counted around 1% more.\\n\\nOverall, if you want to use this watch ONLY for workout and wellbeing tracking (and keep in mind that the watch can track ONLY 10 most basic workouts!) then it\\'s an OK option. It has some advanced algorithms for tracking the energy and stress, besides the sleep and HR (no SpO2 blood oxygen tracking though). But, to be honest, you can do the same workout tracking with 4-5 times cheaper smart bands like Honor or Mi bands... It\\'s a more advanced band with a big screen that looks very nice, and can also show more details on the watch itself, without needing to look into the app.\\nBut, if you want to use this watch as a smart watch (and you would probably want because of its large screen and good looks) then I don\\'t think it\\'s worth its price.

So after investing nearly 14k I have used the product for nearly a week. Any ways product fault can happen which is not my concern. But currently my concern is related to the service os Amazfit. The policy of Amazfit that if there is a product fault I need to get in touch with there service centre so that they will arrange a pickup from my home. Now here I would like to mention few points.\\n1. Getting in touch with the executive is very hard over call as every time the line gets Disconnected automatically after a couple of ring.\\n2. I was able to talk to one of there executive after a days try. He gave me a phone no. And I need to share the photo of my invoice in that no. Then I will get a link which I need to fill to get my product picked up. The executive also mentioned a person from blue dart courier will come to pick up and I need to save his contact no\\n3. I send the photo of that invoice immediately but there were no response. And nearly after 48 hours I got that link from that no. So I filled it up immediately and again I was waiting patiently. Meanwhile I understood that I have to go again a long waiting period as definitely the urgency was from my side not from Amazfit.\\n4. Again a couple of days passed while I got a call from blue dart asking my pincode which is 700129. And out of my misery he told me. My pincode is unserviceable, which I have heard for the first time as I am ordering prducts online and every now and then I am getting them delivered through Bluedart, DTDC, ECart, Delhivery. I requested that person badly and got the reply that he will try.\\n5. Again a couple of days passed by but there were no response from that person. So I tried to contact Amazfit customer care for the entire day yesterday but as usual there were no rebsonse. And finally after trying N number of times I talked to someone again today sometime back at the time of writing this review. And the response I got from him is this is not there's fault but the fault of blue dart. I pleed to him to understand my pain point for once so he told me that he will get back to me and disconnected on my face right away without listening any further.\\nI don't know what should be the next step.

       " 'This review is just for iPhone users. I use iPhone 7 and had an assumption that everything will work as expected but that isn’t the case. May be I did not do proper research before I bought this watch. However to ease out for iPhone users, I am letting my observation out. So people can know what they are going to get when they buy.\\n\\nFeatures as of now:\\n1. Only notifies you that you got a message along with the sender’s name for apps such as Whatsapp, sms etc but you cannot reply or read the message from the watch.\\n\\n2. You will get notified on who is calling with the name and the number, you can either choose to attend or reject, however you cannot speak using the watch.\\n\\nNote: Just browsed the internet and came to know that the OTA update would hit us before the year end. This will enable us to make calls and attend the calls and speak using the watch. Until then we need to wait.\\n\\nFor android they have all liberty to use and no restrictions.\\n\\nNow coming to the look of the watch and performance.\\n\\n1. Watch looks stylish and cool.\\n2.

       " \"Update after few weeks of usage - Everything I reported before is still same. But there is a way to get BP and ECG test on to watch by installing modified versions of Samsung health monitor. So there is a way of getting that to work unofficially.\\n\\nI have bought the 45mm BT version of this watch. This is my experience after using it for 2 days.\\n\\nPrice - Reasonable. I purchased with the launch offer at 28k. It is relatively expensive compared to Android Wear watch options, but I think if you have a Samsung Phone, it might be worth it. I have Samsung Note 10 and Samsung works well with Samsung, but I think with the necessary apps installed it'll work the same way on other Android phones.\\n\\nAndroid Wear vs Tizen: I previously had Fossil Explorist Gen 4 watch which runs on Android Wear. In my personal experience, Android Wear as an operating system needs a lot of work. The Fossil watch was unbearably slow, battery backup was very bad, thought it could do the normal smartwatch things, because of the poor battery, I couldn't use it at all. I just kept the watch on Flight mode and used as a normal watch to display time. My experience here could be biased as I didn't really use Android wear to the fullest. I used it for Navigation a few times, but for that to work, the same Google Maps app has to be open on your phone. It will just tether the content to the watch. On contrary, Tizen doesn't really have Google Maps app or any equivalent navigation alternatives. So it may not be the best for Navigation. Otherwise, the OS basically looks like a modern Smart Watch - with widgets, notification area, quick control panel etc.\\n\\nThe watch has an option called Automatic WiFi where it will connect to the WiFi in case it gets disconnected from the phone (Bluetooth). This is super useful. On Samsung phones, there is an option called Call and Text on other devices. If you are signed in with your Samsung account and this option is enabled, even when my phone isn't connected to watch, I can still make and receive calls just using watch while it is connected to WiFi. This is such a great option, just like the LTE version, but on Bluetooth watch using WiFi.\\n\\nHealth Features: The watch DOESN'T have ECG enabled in Indian units. They recently got approval in US from FDA but who knows what regulations are there in India and if it will ever come to this. The hardware required is there in the watch, just that Samsung has to get approvals and enable it through Software. Even last year's Galaxy Watch Active 2 is waiting for this. So don't get the hopes high about this. Other than this, it has Blood Oxygen tracking which works, Heart Rate sensor and automatic workout detection. There are a bunch of pre-set workouts in the watch that it can track. And it does a pretty good job. Using Samsung Health app on phone, you can get access to a lot more third party exercise tutorials.\\n\\nSleep tracking is also available on the watch and it works great. It can precisely track sleep in my opinion and gives out detailed analysis of sleep pattern and efficiency. Once you connect the watch to phone via Bluetooth, all these data gets synced with phone and you can detailed overview on the Samsung Health app on phone.\\n\\nBattery: Battery lasts 2 days if you don't have the always on display. If watch is always on to show time, it takes up a lot more battery. During these 2 days, I used it to track a lot of my exercises, sleep tracking, basic notifications and the battery easily lasted 2 days. But I had the always on disabled. There is a toggle on the watch itself through which you can easily turn this on and off to save battery when required.\\n\\nMiscellaneous: The watch band feels very cheap and light. Though it says leather, the leather band I have with Fossil watch feels a lot premium. This watch band even makes cheap plastic type of noise when you try to wear it. Otherwise, watch is pretty comfortable to wear. Also I prefer the way Fossil looks. This watch looks more like a fitness watch than a regular watch.\\n\\nSo to end the review, following are the pros and cons in my opinion:\\n\\nPros: Great battery backup - almost 2 days, easy to charge using any wireless chargers, has a tonne of features - you can check YouTube videos to know all the features available, works perfectly with Samsung phones, can connect to WiFi in case it is not connected to phone via Bluetooth and you can still make and receive phone calls. This works only with Samsung phones I think, so check about this if this is important.\\n\\nCons: ECG doesn't work yet, watch band feels very light and cheap, no proper Navigation app, lack of app support because of Tizen OS\",\n",

I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. 🥇\",\n",
       " \" Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself. I wanted to get an Apple Watch for my wife as I was impressed by the design but fortunately I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.\\n\\n----------------------\\n📦 IN THE BOX\\n----------------------\\n፨ The smart watch module with screen protector applied\\n፨ 22mm wide TPU strap\\n፨ Charging cable\\n፨ Instruction Manual and Warranty Registration card\\n\\n--------------------\\n⌚ FEATURES\\n--------------------\\n፨ 1.3 inch 240x240 capacitive display\\n፨ Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,\\n፨ IP68 Full dustproof and waterproof\\n፨ 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage, 45 days standby\\n፨ Bluetooth 5.0 BLE\\n፨ 24/7 heart Rate sensor, sedentary alarm, breathe feature, and usual health and sleep monitoring.\\n፨ App, message, social media and call notifications.\\n፨ Music control\\n፨ Menstrual cycle tracking\\n፨ 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.\\n\\n---------------------\\n🗓️ MY USAGE\\n---------------------\\n፨ At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn’t get allergy with sweat on this band.\\n፨ The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.\\n፨ The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.\\n፨ The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.\\n፨ There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.\\n፨ The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.\\n፨ There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.\\n፨ The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).\\n፨ Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.\\n፨ The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.\\n፨ I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.\\n፨ There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n💖 WHAT I LIKED\\n-------------------------\\n◾ The premium design and great display.

       " \"This is going to be a long review, scroll to the end for summery. I've already been using Mi band 4 for over a year so I'll compare with it wherever required.\\n\\n//SCREEN: Screen is just gorgeous! It's full touch AMOLED 1.1inch, which is almost 20% bigger than my Mi band 4's 0.95inch. You'll instantly appreciate the extra real estate. Everything is crisp and bright. There's is anti-fingerprint coating (which works) but sadly no gorilla glass. And it's very hard to find and put screen guard due to it's curved glass. My MB4 has many scratches after a year of use and I expect the same in MB5. Display is clearly visible under direct sunlight.\\n\\n//STRAP and COMFORT: Strap is rubbery plastic, same as Mi Band 4 but size is different, so MB4 strap will not fit here. It doesn't produce much sweat and overall, it's light and comfortable. You'll forget it's on your wrist after a while. Band is also non-intrusive while sleeping. I've also wore My band in drizzle, while washing hands and in full blown rain, it's totally waterproof.\\n\\n//BATTERY: Battery has always been a big plus on Mi Band series. I used to get around 12-13 days battery on Mi Band 4 with continuous heart rate monitor enables and 17+ days without it. In Mi band 5, my battery is 58% after 5 days of use, so seems like battery life is almost same as before. BUT the charging mechanism has changed! I think it is one of the most significant upgrade since Mi Band 1. It was very inefficient and cluttery but now it's simply a breeze! You don't have to remove the tracker now so strap life may also improve, who knows.\\n\\nEXTRA FEATURES: Mi band 4 and Mi band 5 both has lift to wake, timer, stopwatch, weather up to 5 days, vibration alarm, ideal sitting alert, music and volume change, find my phone feature. You can silent the phone from band. Receive notifications from phone, dismiss notifications, Reject and silent calls and change the brightness of the band from band itself. All the features are very refined\\nand works without any problem or bug whatever. Mi band 5 also has remote shutter control to capture images from phone.\\n\\nHEALTH TRACKING and FEATURES: Now the most important part. All other features are useless if the band can't track properly. Mi band 4 had 2 big flaws in sleep tracking - it couldn't track REM sleep and couldn't track mid-day naps! Fortunately, both the features are included in Mi band 5. It is a significant change and my favourite upgrade after the charger. Other sleep tracking features are as accurate as ever. Xiaomi claims that they've improved the heart rate sensor but I'm getting almost same reading on both Mi Band 4 and 5 (with 2-3- point difference). Mi band 5 now has some new indoor sports mode which gym lovers will love! It has indoor cycling, rowing machine and Elliptical, although the data you get in this is very limited. It also has Yoga mode now (which is not very accurate). Step counter is ok-ish (with 80-90% accuracy roughly) but the running mode is wonderful with connected GPS (your phone's) it provides so much data like pace, stride rate, average heart rate, real time heart rate, map, average speed, personal best and so on! You'll love running after wearing Mi band. Mi band 5 includes new stress meter (which is fun to use, just take its data with a pinch of salt), and PAI (personal activity index) about which I'll update the review after some use. Tracking feature of Mi band 5 are best for any fitness tracker under Rs 10k imo. Moreover, all the features are very refined and well-designed. You'll not encounter any bug or hiccups while using them, they just work as expected.\\n\\n\\\\\\\\ CONS: Now some flaws\\n- Design is very outdated. Although it's comfortable but It looks very small if you have big hands.\\n- The stripping mechanism is also not very good. I was expecting that Xiaomi will improve it at least a bit in this upgrade but seems like I'll have to wait another year.\\n- The weather feature doesn't work most of the time. It says 'connect the band to show weather', even though I'm connected. Same problem was there in MB 4. Seems like Xiaomi ignored it.\\n- Xiaomi should introduce some metallic straps. There are 3rd party straps available but their quality is just bad.\\n- Ads in android app. Ruins the whole experience.\\n- No SpO2 meter. Although not as useful, but still good to have.\\n- No scratch resistent glass. or at least provide good first party curved tempered glass.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Mi Band 5 is not as significant an upgrade as MB 3 to 4. But the magnetic charger, improved sleep tracking and indoor sports mode are all excellent upgrade. Not to mention the extra screen estate. As for the first-time buyers, Mi band is the most accurate band you'll get under Rs 10k. No other band or watch in this range have such polished UI, reliable tracking and fine hardware quality.\\n\\nEdit: I'll update add some photos of band and screenshots of tracking data soon.\",\n",

The best part about this watch is how accurately it measures my Blood Oxygen levels (Spo2), Blood Pressure and BPM (beats per minute). The construction is super lightweight and feels very premium. The HD display is bright and has been keeping up pretty well even under direct sunlight.

Quite disappointed as I feel my daily goal achievements till now are not accurate. Probably I might be taking only 5k steps in my reported steps of 10k.\\nI doubt about heartrate and sleep monitor also now. Did not expect this kind of flaw in version 2.

The HD display is bright and has been keeping up pretty well even under direct sunlight.

       " 'I have been a user of Apple Watch from last few months. I bought Garmin Venu Sq for my brother, who has an android phone. First of all, if you are an iPhone user, go for Apple Watch, as they work great in Apple ecosystem, sync seamlessly, has great display and user friendly UI.\\n\\nNow coming to the Garmin Venu SQ, I will list out pros and cons.\\n\\nPROs:\\n1) I had thoroughly researched about the accuracy of smartwatches, and found that Garmin is second only to Apple watches. Apple watches has near-industry level accuracy, whereas Garmin watches comes second. Fitbit comes a close 3rd, but with the constant nagging to get Fitbit premium, I did not even consider it. Samsung watches are good, but they are more of a smartwatch with few fitness functions, unlike Garmin which is basically a fitness device with few smartwatch functions. ACCURACY RATING: 9/10\\n2) Good enough sports modes, with customisable data fields for each mode. Tracking is expected to be accurate. SPORTS TRACKING: 9/10\\n3) Other measurement like body battery, stress level, steps were accurate enough for daily uses. 9/10\\n4) Battery life is good. Runs for roughly 5-6 days on average with continuous SpO2 tracking. BATTERY RATING: 9/10\\n5) Extremely well designed mobile application. Shows relevant information. Garmin Connect IQ store has decent collection of watch faces (round shape), widgets, apps, data fields, etc that can be downloaded. Extremely customisable to the point that you can even decide colours of data field. Apple should learn from it. APPS AND STORE RATINGS: 10/10\\n6) Syncing of data is instantaneous between app and watch. Sometimes I did face some issues. for e.g. when I downloaded watch faces, it would queue it up for no reason and then take some 2-3 minutes for it to reflect on watch. But other than this, no issues. SYNC RATING: 9/10\\n\\nCONs:\\n1) First of all, its display. The display looks like it is a watch from early 2010s. The LCD display looks so washed out that it is difficult to see even in normal indoor lighting despite maxed out brightness setting. Let\\'s not even talk about how it looks outdoor. I instantly hated the display the moment it was switched on. DISPLAY RATING: 3/10\\n2) One factor that could have compensated for the disappointing display is the watch faces. However, on the Garmin store, most of the watch faces is for round watches, not for square. If you install a watch face meant for round faces to Garmin Venu Sq, it gets stretched, and covers less that half of already small display size of Venu sq. All in all, there are hardly 5-6 watch faces that uses the whole screen on Venu Sq, but those faces are extremely \"boring\". The few faces which are good and needs to be purchased, are not available for purchase in India. So the display that my brother is using is the standard one that comes pre-installed in watch - the washed out, hard to see display. WATCH FACES - 2/10 (particularly compared to it similarly priced Apple Watch Series 3 which has amazing watch face options with dynamic interactions)\\n3) I did not find sleep tracking to be very accurate. Many YouTubers had the same experience. However, I will not complain much here since my almost double expensive Apple Watch does not even have inbuilt sleep tracking and has to use 3rd party apps. SLEEP TRACKING - 7/10\\n4) SpO2 reading - not very accurate. Sometimes shows accurate reading, sometimes its off by 3-4 % age points. All in all, do not rely on this watch\\'s SpO2 reading and better to have a specialised device for that. (Again this is the issue with all SpO2 tracking smartwatches)\\n5) Garmin Pay is not available in India.\\n6) The raise-to-wake is decently responsive. But another biggest disappointment comes from double-tap to wake function. It doesn\\'t work half of the time. I have to double-tap 2-3 times to wake it once. Even then sometimes it doesn\\'t show anything. Then I have to press the physical button to wake it up. RESPONSIVENESS : 6/10\\n7) GPS sometimes doesn\\'t gets locked in. But this is extremely rare.\\n8) Other must have function like Flashlight is not present.\\n\\nSo should you buy it?\\nIt depends on what you want, you age and preferences. Those of you who just want an accurate smartwatch and wants to get into \"Garmin ecosystem\", but does not care about display quality, watch faces, UI interactiveness, can go for it. However, those who have seen the interactiveness of Apple watches, or Fitbit or Samsung galaxy and active watches, may fight this watch \"boring\". If you have single minded focus of using this watch as a fitness device, then go for it. However, if you are looking for a smartwatch which can replace your mobile, take calls, reply texts, voice detection, this is not the watch for you.\\nIf in the future, vibrant colours and watch faces get available in the Garmin store specifically designed for Venu SQ, then this watch can become a decent choice to buy.',\n",

If you install a watch face meant for round faces to Garmin Venu Sq, it gets stretched, and covers less that half of already small display size of Venu sq. All in all, there are hardly 5-6 watch faces that uses the whole screen on Venu Sq, but those faces are extremely \"boring\". The few faces which are good and needs to be purchased, are not available for purchase in India. So the display that my brother is using is the standard one that comes pre-installed in watch - the washed out, hard to see display. WATCH FACES - 2/10 (particularly compared to it similarly priced Apple Watch Series 3 which has amazing watch face options with dynamic interactions)\\n3) I did not find sleep tracking to be very accurate. Many YouTubers had the same experience. However, I will not complain much here since my almost double expensive Apple Watch does not even have inbuilt sleep tracking and has to use 3rd party apps. SLEEP TRACKING - 7/10\\n4) SpO2 reading - not very accurate. Sometimes shows accurate reading, sometimes its off by 3-4 % age points. All in all, do not rely on this watch\\'s SpO2 reading and better to have a specialised device for that. (Again this is the issue with all SpO2 tracking smartwatches)\\n5) Garmin Pay is not available in India.\\n6) The raise-to-wake is decently responsive. But another biggest disappointment comes from double-tap to wake function. It doesn\\'t work half of the time. I have to double-tap 2-3 times to wake it once. Even then sometimes it doesn\\'t show anything. Then I have to press the physical button to wake it up. RESPONSIVENESS : 6/10\\n7) GPS sometimes doesn\\'t gets locked in. But this is extremely rare.\\n8) Other must have function like Flashlight is not present.\\n\\nSo should you buy it?\\nIt depends on what you want, you age and preferences. Those of you who just want an accurate smartwatch and wants to get into \"Garmin ecosystem\", but does not care about display quality, watch faces, UI interactiveness, can go for it. However, those who have seen the interactiveness of Apple watches, or Fitbit or Samsung galaxy and active watches, may fight this watch \"boring\". If you have single minded focus of using this watch as a fitness device, then go for it. However, if you are looking for a smartwatch which can replace your mobile, take calls, reply texts, voice detection, this is not the watch for you.\\nIf in the future, vibrant colours and watch faces get available in the Garmin store specifically designed for Venu SQ, then this watch can become a decent choice to buy.',\n",
       " 'I have been a user of Apple Watch from last few months. I bought Garmin Venu Sq for my brother, who has an android phone. First of all, if you are an iPhone user, go for Apple Watch, as they work great in Apple ecosystem, sync seamlessly, has great display and user friendly UI.\\n\\nNow coming to the Garmin Venu SQ, I will list out pros and cons.\\n\\nPROs:\\n1) I had thoroughly researched about the accuracy of smartwatches, and found that Garmin is second only to Apple watches. Apple watches has near-industry level accuracy, whereas Garmin watches comes second. Fitbit comes a close 3rd, but with the constant nagging to get Fitbit premium, I did not even consider it. Samsung watches are good, but they are more of a smartwatch with few fitness functions, unlike Garmin which is basically a fitness device with few smartwatch functions. ACCURACY RATING: 9/10\\n2) Good enough sports modes, with customisable data fields for each mode. Tracking is expected to be accurate. SPORTS TRACKING: 9/10\\n3) Other measurement like body battery, stress level, steps were accurate enough for daily uses. 9/10\\n4) Battery life is good. Runs for roughly 5-6 days on average with continuous SpO2 tracking. BATTERY RATING: 9/10\\n5) Extremely well designed mobile application. Shows relevant information. Garmin Connect IQ store has decent collection of watch faces (round shape), widgets, apps, data fields, etc that can be downloaded. Extremely customisable to the point that you can even decide colours of data field. Apple should learn from it. APPS AND STORE RATINGS: 10/10\\n6) Syncing of data is instantaneous between app and watch. Sometimes I did face some issues. for e.g. when I downloaded watch faces, it would queue it up for no reason and then take some 2-3 minutes for it to reflect on watch. But other than this, no issues. SYNC RATING: 9/10\\n\\nCONs:\\n1) First of all, its display. The display looks like it is a watch from early 2010s. The LCD display looks so washed out that it is difficult to see even in normal indoor lighting despite maxed out brightness setting. Let\\'s not even talk about how it looks outdoor. I instantly hated the display the moment it was switched on. DISPLAY RATING: 3/10\\n2) One factor that could have compensated for the disappointing display is the watch faces.

The HD display is bright and has been keeping up pretty well even under direct sunlight.

(experiencing this issue ~40% of the times)\\n• Many times, the weather statistics do not regularly update even when phone is connected to the watch with phone’s GPS and Wi-Fi ON.\\n• In the custom watch face setup, option should be provided to add maybe a few widgets for example at least Heart Rate, Step Count and weather. Currently on custom watch face, only time can be displayed. At the price tag of INR 7490 this watch feels more of a fitness band with GPS and bigger display.\\n• The 4gb memory is not of any use to the user. It might be used to store the watch faces that we download and for firmware update probably.\\n• No speaker. It would have been better if for alarm/timers and stuff, the watch provided some beeping sounds along with the vibration.\\n• If the watch has an in-built GPS, then why not provide a sensor for temperature as well. Even for weather it should automatically show the updated weather in a region as per the GPS without relying on the smartphone itself.\\n\\nPros:\\n• AMOLED display: The display looks very sharp and most of the watch faces look amazing on it. Overall, it is very nice to look at.\\n• Battery life is decent. I charged it to 100% on Thursday afternoon and by Monday afternoon it was at 40%.

The best part about this watch is how accurately it measures my Blood Oxygen levels (Spo2), Blood Pressure and BPM (beats per minute). The construction is super lightweight and feels very premium. The HD display is bright and has been keeping up pretty well even under direct sunlight. It has a powerful battery back up of 15 days and I have used it for workouts, and the water resistance is really impressive. The included strap is also very comfortable and I have had no irritations while wearing it.',\n",

It has a powerful battery back up of 15 days and I have used it for workouts, and the water resistance is really impressive. The included strap is also very comfortable and I have had no irritations while wearing it.',\n",

       " 'Hi,\\nI received this band on 16/7/2020. I bought this for temperature and Blood pressure monitoring. I have Citizen BP monitor as well which is very accurate and just next to Analog BP monitor. I felt that since Technology evolved, there are so many advanced techniques introduced, let\\'s give it a try and decided to buy this device which will measure accurate BP all the time resting on your wrist. My wife has Chronic Low Blood pressure symptoms for day time. I wanted to monitor that consistently. Also my Mother has a slightly higher than normal BP at the age of 62. Me and my wife are 36 years old. So in my family, for continuous monitoring BP I had ordered this and was going to order more if it was accurate as such. But I found that\\n1) When I checked my BP on Goqii and another BP Monitor (Citizen) both gave approximately same results. Note that I have Normal BP levels usually.\\n2) When I tested this device on my mother, readings on these 2 devices were not matching, Goqii was showing slightly lower and normal ranged reading than Citizen.\\n3) When I tested my wife for getting her Blood pressure, her BP amazingly came normal as such (114/70). Then I found that there is a setting in the app to set your BP levels. (Shown in pictures)\\n4) Then for my wife I changed BP setting to Low and got reading as (88/58) which was also not accurate compared to Citizen.\\n5) Quickly I changed the mode from \"Low\" to \"High\" and retested it and that gave me reading as (133/86). Just within 2 minutes the BP changed from 114/70 (Normal) to 88/58(Low) and again to 133/86(High) for a same person with change in settings?\\nIs this a kind of joke?\\nI was repeatedly confirming that the band is snug fit. Now the questions come\\n\\n1) Does your analog BP monitor or other digital monitor ask you for settings to give you BP readings?\\n2) If you have a normal BP usually and due to some tension/reasons it goes higher. When you need to be alerted for resting, instead rely on this band to get normal ranged reading, is it OK to you?\\n3) If a person like my wife with lower BPs should I keep setting as \"Low\" and when it\\'s showing lower than 80/50 should I rush to doctor with fear just to know that wrist band gave false reading?\\n4) If you are having diabetes and one morning you wake up with low BP like (70/40) which is severe case of hospitalization (which I have already seen with my relative) but instead your usual normal BP setting shows you that your BP is (100/70) will you sense the necessity of hospitalization?\\n5) More than anything, unlike me who knows everyone\\'s BP levels in my family, a person who doesn\\'t have prior knowledge of his own BP levels, he purchases this band, but can he achieve correct BP readings for monitoring?\\n6) If any one of you or manufacturer who is reading my review thinks that I\\'m expecting too much from a 3,800/- rupees band then what is the necessity for everyone to purchase such stupid half knowledgedly invented device which are sold on platforms like Amazon and brand ambassador like Akshay Kumar to advertise this in the name of Fitness band. (Or manufacturer should have not added this feature itself). For all the other purposes the other fitness bands on Amazon can easily be bought for around 2k.\\n\\nI finally returned the product with disappointment and received a refund but the review was must to spread awareness whosoever is purchasing this device. Buy it check for yourself.',\n",

The problem using this watch with an iPhone is that it won\\'t connect. At first it ll get connected easily but as time goes it auto disconnects without any reason, and when you try to reconnect it says \"make sure Bluetooth is turned on\"\\nWear OS needs a lot of Polish. The watch has good features like heart rate monitor and make / attend calls via watch. But not recommended for an iPhone user.\\n\\nI had to return this watch. Make sure you test it in a store or something before purchasing it.',\n",

       " \"Original 3rd Jan 2021: This is my first smartwatch. I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family, but this is my personal first. I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and I'm aware of most of the products in the budget range. While I can afford a slightly more expensive one (GTS2/GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro, Oppo Watch, Fitbit etc) with calling feature, I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first. I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa (yet to be included, but must be available through an OTA update). I'd have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display (has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro). It still isn't released in India.\\nComing to the watch's performance, the typical features I tried today (first day) are Heart RATE (HR), SPO2, Stress monitoring and GPS. I have a pulse oximeter from Dr. Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2. The numbers on the watch aren't very accurate to my surprise (heart rate variation by 5-10 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10% points at times) . But I still feel it's more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc. GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house. It won't surprise me if I don't get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc. The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone. Music controls worked fine, bluetooth data transfer or sync was good. I couldn't control the phone camera as I couldn't get that feature to work (refer to image and help me if you can). I didn't face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications. The readability on the watch screen has been really good. Tried a couple of workouts. While the step count seems to be fine, not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes.\\nTo conclude, I wouldn't say that this watch is a disappointment, but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats. Probably I should give it more time, but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy (at least the Honor bands I've seen). Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as I'm curious what all it can do.\\nI would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days. Let's see.\\nUpdate (8th Jan 2021): The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out. I'm hardly getting it for 3.5 days with always on display and an occasional workout. Limited watch faces, both on device (4) and the app (57). Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display. Waterproof nature of the device is good. I didn't dip it in water, but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action. I got the camera shutter to work. I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa. Notifications didn't have an issue, but could not clear individual items (clear all worked)\",\n",

The HD display is bright and has been keeping up pretty well even under direct sunlight.

Even with the decreased price now, there are better options in the market.\",\n",

       " 'This is an Outstanding Smart Watch plus a Great Health Gadget. Firstly, the SPO2 count and Stress Monitor are really Great, which made me prefer this watch over others. I have been proven right on every aspect. Secondly, it has a great syncing capability with mobile. Coming to the features:\\n\\n1. Heart rate monitor is real-time and gives accurate readings as per my view. Step count is also get accurate. In Indoor Activities, it effectively counts the number of steps.\\n\\n2. Stress Monitor is the best feature in this watch!!!. It is inbuilt with two types of alerts (Can be disabled too)- one to alert you to move when you are stationary for a long time and the other to alert you to relax when your stress levels are beyond high. Both are highly useful👍🏻. It has a relaxation feature if you want to reduce your stress. It makes you to do systematic breathing - inhalation, retention, exhalation and further retention, which effectively reduces the stress.\\n\\n3. SPO2 monitor: This too as per my view, is accurate. But it takes some time to calculate and works only when the watch is worn properly. Often, it gives an error \"check watch fit\". Need to hold the watch on the hand in a fixed way, to get it the first time.\\n\\n4. Music: This is a great Addon through which the music playing on the mobile (When Bluetooth earphones are connected) can be controlled through the watch, once connected. Volume can also be controlled through this. Name of the track and the artist can be seen on the screen.\\n\\n5. Garmin Connect: This is app to be downloaded from App Store and is the Monitor for all the above Monitors!!!. It gives a great and detailed view of all the activities throughout the period worn. It gives a map of the outdoor activities with GPS enabled. It has some really nice and motivating challenges like weekly and monthly challenges for many activities like walking, running, etc for motivating us to get moving. These challenges may be self targets or with general public, where top 10 members participating in the challenge will be displayed as a leader board. In addition, there would be daily goal feature for number of steps and intensity minutes, the failure of which will give you a red mark.\\n\\n6. Sleep Sensor: This too is another great feature, for measuring the quality of sleep. It also has a daily goal of 8 hours, which keeps us motivated not to stay too late. It shows the quality of sleep - whether light or deep or REM and for how much time. However, sometimes this does not get captured correctly in the app, in which case, we need to enter the time manually.\\n\\n7. Connect IQ: This is the official store for purchasing addons like watch faces, utilities, etc. There are some free ones and paid ones, which can be chosen as per the taste and requirement.\\n\\n8. Syncing with mobile: Calls can be accepted (Not answered) and messages and notifications to the mobile can be viewed (Preformatted replies can also be given) and we can set which app can give notifications.\\n\\n9. GPS: This watch has an inbuilt GPS and can remember locations when stored.\\n\\nAdded to the above, there are many other features like shortcuts, alarm, stopwatch, find my watch, etc, which are great plus for this watch. The touch of the watch is also very smooth and the glass is stain resistant and water proof.\\n\\nOn the whole, this watch is a Great Health companion, along with serving the features of a smart watch.',\n",

       " \"*Most Beautiful Jewelry, Long Battery Life, Big Clear Display, Outrageous Price, Horrific App Install Process*\\nI'm very happy with this watch as it is what I wanted it to be - a Gorgeous piece of jewelry (Note: most youtube reviews are done under very bright light making the colours look lighter than they really are) and a week of battery life with Always On Display turned on. I reviewed every fitness tracker and smartwatch and found that ALL smartwatches have only a couple/few days of battery. NB. this is a fitness tracker and NOT a smartwatch (defn: smartwatches can run downloaded apps; fitness trackers cannot - and just for fun there is some overlap).\\nThe display is large and bright and the sound (eg. for a phone call) is remarkably clear and loud. There's 10 watch faces and 6 Always On Faces. Watch came with leather strap ONLY. I've got quick/one-tap access to weather - in detail - very useful when leaving the house (will it rain?).\\nThe app is good.

The best part about this watch is how accurately it measures my Blood Oxygen levels (Spo2), Blood Pressure and BPM (beats per minute). The construction is super lightweight and feels very premium. The HD display is bright and has been keeping up pretty well even under direct sunlight. It has a powerful battery back up of 15 days and I have used it for workouts, and the water resistance is really impressive. The included strap is also very comfortable and I have had no irritations while wearing it.',\n",

       " \"I have been using smart watches for three year. All of them have been Fitbit. I got bored of them and was looking for a good SMWatch which is when I looked at Samsung Galaxy Active 2 LTE. Been 1 week since I started using it and I should say, this is an amazing piece of art both inside and out. The following are the highlights I noticed\\n\\n1. Beautiful round shaped ergonomically designed body dial with responsive bezel control.\\n2. Cross checked the step count and hear rate with Fitbit. Step count is super accurate. Heart rate varies 1 to 2 bpm which is OK. Very much under tolerance level.\\n3. Beautiful leather strap. Easy to pin the strap to the leather, if you are coming from Fitbit Versa you know how important this is. Also it doesn't cause any itching. But pls make sure water doesn't stay on it for long time. You may lose it soon\\n4. Auto detection of exercises are super accurate again. Walk and run is auto detected. Yet to check how it treats weights. Waiting for Gyms to reopen\\n5. Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with heavy usage (kept exploring the watch, 4G is on and sometimes I take call in the watch. No music.) This is way lower than Fitbit. But I will get used to it I believe\\n6. U may get confused on how the trio - Phone, watch and buds - are paired. You will not be able to use ur buds if u attend a call in watch when your phone is nearby. You can use the buds only if you use the standalone watch 4G. Still exploring this area.\\n7. Bit expensive. I will give a 4 star for value for money. Again 4 star because this is probably the best smart watch available in the market\\n\\nLastly, Amazon's delivery was good. It was delayed by a day. But I understand they are prioritizing the essentials considering that this is a good service\\n\\nLet me know if anyone want any specific info and I can help with it.\",\n",

Also, I bought this for ₹6.5k and now the price is reduced to ₹3k in some other etailers, which made me very sad, and now I think it wasn't worth buying this piece of tech.\\n\\nIt does the exact same thing as Mi Band or others, it doesn't sync with other apps like Runtastic or Strava which is such an important thing for cyclists or runners. It doesn't sync with Apple Health which is again such a useless thing. Zero customization options, and way behind in features list.\\n\\nOriginal review (1st September 2019 - a month after I bought it)\\nThere are a lot of arguments on why we should get a Fitbit, its definitely more expensive than any other fitness bands out there and I agree with that too.\\n\\n✴️ I have used Mi Band before and it definitely does a very very good job and that's the worst part about Fitbit, it does the almost same job except for a few knicks and knacks (if you notice) like good interactions and animations on the screen, etc and of course brand name.\\n✳️ So it automatically detects your activity, if you workout or exercise (but sometimes it takes auto rides or bike rides into that) however it never mistakes the steps and walking. As far as my experience goes, the step counter and pedometer work best.\\n✴️ The app is good though but I had some issues during setup and syncing with my notification first time, it took a few days and multiple phone reboots to get it right. I was very disappointed to know that it doesn't work with Google Fit and Apple Health, so that's a turn-off.\\n✴️ You only get few watch faces, can't download more (i think there's only 8-10).\\n✴️ Raise your wrist doesn't work really well though and I don't think it has a tap to wake (although sometimes it does tap to wake and I'm unable to figure how or when it works).\\n✴️ The battery gives standby of 3-4 days irrespective of your phone syncing with it or not (i thought the non-HR version would give more backup but it doesn't).\\n✴️ It really had some good straps available online, but it takes time for them to get delivered since they are all imported and you'll not find anything in physical stores, nothing is sold in India. And same goes with any accessories attached to it, like chargers, its really hard to get your hands on that stuff.\\n\\n🔴 The final verdict would be not to spend so much money on a fitness band especially Fitbit Inspire, buy something cheap (and get an expensive timepiece or Android Watch or Apple Watch or something) 🔴\\n\\nIf you are looking to buy Fitbit only, Fitbit Charge or Fitbit Versa, this is not worth it, at all.\",\n",

       " \"Review updated after more than a month of usage:\\nSummary: If you have been oscillating between sense and apple watch 6 series, go for sense - battery life is what sealed the deal for me. Amazing beautiful watch - perfect companion for a journey to good health.\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Great battery life - I have been using this watch full blast with always on display and using the EDA sensor at least thrice a day, and installing and uninstalling so many watch faces. Third straight day, and the battery is still there.\\nEdit: In a month I installed so many apps and watch faces and have now stabilised with select 5. Battery performance is superb. On weekends I forget to charge and it is cool.\\n2. The EDA/ stress sensor: Very responsive. I checked the EDA scan feature a few times. It actually gave more EDA responses when I was a little stressed. Seems like a very handy tool for me - especially because I have had stress related issues in the past. It is a perfect companion for my daily meditation and Yoga practice too.\\nEdit after a month usage: EDA/ stress sensor is good but it doesnt tell you anything you dont know already.\\nFor future edit: At times, I feel restless and anxious - and I calm myself by taking a quick walk around. Will check what the EDA scan says at that time. Will update - still havent faced the issue again.\\n3. Heart rate tracker - It is fitbit's best. And fitbit is already the best out there in HR tracking. So no further comments.\\nEdit after a month: At times while exercising, I feel there is a lag in the heartbeat numbers. Or maybe that's how our hearts work - they take some seconds before they can fire up. :) Will keep an eye on this.\\n4. Notifications: Using with iPhone. Everything as expected. If it could show a preview of the image in messages, it would have been awesome! I did see this discussion happening in the fitbit developer forum - so I guess it is in the works.\\nEdit after a month: Still no news on image in notifications. I don't mind this though.\\n5. Step tracking - Precise.\\n6. Sleep tracking - Sweet.\\nEdit after a month: One of the most used features for me - everyday sleep score tracking is really helping me with my stress management. Recently got an 'excellent sleep' badge tag - for the first time in my 2 years of fitbit usage (wore Inspire HR earlier - that also tracked sleep)\\n7. Band is too light - I have upgraded from fitbit inspire HR. Had used an after market stainless band for that - compared to that, the sense band is thin air. While sleeping, I tend to forget I am wearing the sense.\\n8. Special tid-bits that I loved:\\na. It has a smart alarm feature - which wakes you up before your alarm if you complete a sleep cycle within half an hour of your upcoming alarm. This makes you wake up fresh af, instead of groggy - like the regular alarms do, if you are in the middle of your sleep cycle. Neat.\\nb. Amazing watch-faces. A lot of free options to choose from. The one which allows personal photos to be put up as a watch face is cool. I bought a chronograph one for 1 dollar. Can change accent color as per my clothing. Pretty cool. Too many amazing watch faces.\\nEdit after a month: Too many sweet free watch faces. Paying a dollar wasnt worth the purchase I made a month ago. :D\\nc. Many knick-knack apps you can install and try on. I like the weather app and the news app. Guess more will be coming soon. Flipboard doesnt work yet - guess it will work in future.\\n\\nSpecial trick: Made the ECG work in India by just changing the location to US in the app profile. No VPN required. Works like a charm! What an easy way to hoodwink the policy loopholes - guess it was designed that way - makes one an accomplice in cheating the policy, though. Smart.\\n.\\n.\\nCons:\\n1. It is not apple smart watch.

While the sense comes with a 6 months membership of the premium part of the app, I would not really want to spend some 849 rs per month post 6 months of buying a 30k smartwatch!

I wanted to get an Apple Watch for my wife as I was impressed by the design but fortunately I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.\\n\\n----------------------\\n📦 IN THE BOX\\n----------------------\\n፨ The smart watch module with screen protector applied\\n፨ 22mm wide TPU strap\\n፨ Charging cable\\n፨ Instruction Manual and Warranty Registration card\\n\\n--------------------\\n⌚ FEATURES\\n--------------------\\n፨ 1.3 inch 240x240 capacitive display\\n፨ Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,\\n፨ IP68 Full dustproof and waterproof\\n፨ 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage, 45 days standby\\n፨ Bluetooth 5.0 BLE\\n፨ 24/7 heart Rate sensor, sedentary alarm, breathe feature, and usual health and sleep monitoring.\\n፨ App, message, social media and call notifications.\\n፨ Music control\\n፨ Menstrual cycle tracking\\n፨ 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.\\n\\n---------------------\\n🗓️ MY USAGE\\n---------------------\\n፨ At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn’t get allergy with sweat on this band.\\n፨ The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.\\n፨ The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.\\n፨ The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.\\n፨ There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.\\n፨ The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.\\n፨ There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.\\n፨ The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).\\n፨ Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.\\n፨ The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.\\n፨ I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.\\n፨ There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n💖 WHAT I LIKED\\n-------------------------\\n◾ The premium design and great display. Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.\\n◾ Battery life of 7 to 10 days.\\n◾ IPX68 dust and waterproof.\\n◾ Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring\\n◾ Better control & display of calls, messages and music from the band\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n♻️ WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n◾ More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.\\n◾ Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.\\n\\n-------------------\\n🍱 OVERALL\\n-------------------\\nThe MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. 🥇\",\n",

       " 'I was excited about this watch and purchased it on its launch day, there by making the worst mistake of my life.\\n\\n10 reasonable reasons to avoid noise ultra and save 4.5k!\\n\\n1 - Major issues are with watch faces it take years of time to apply a watch face from the app, once applied its stores in their volatile memory means if you again want to apply a new face from store the old one will vanish again from your history making it again wasting a lot of time to apply as their is no concept of my watch faces.This is the worst nightmare for any smartwatch user.\\n2 - watch faces have lot of bugs, not smooth. In my picture you can see the sleep display is merged with calories. Wake by lift wrist feature is not accurate, it does not work while you are sleeping.\\n3 - Attached in picture, if in your contacts some name is greater than 15 characters of string then when they call or msg their name will be blurred out as shown. So you need to cut down their name to get it notified.\\n4 - Very difficult to update the firmware as the software is filled with bugs, as you can see my watch was almost full charge still its not allowing to upgrade the firmware, saying battery has to be more than 30% of charge, again had to reset reinstall and repair.\\n5 - App keeps on crashing, so again reset reinstall and re pair.\\n6 - Not tested on android but the app heats and burn the ios when you sync the watch or apply watch faces, making the phone very hot.\\n7 - Their world clock timezones arrangement is not good, very difficult to fine us timezones and most of the central timezones are missing!\\n8 - Poor quality strap, had to use third party straps and touch lags like anything.\\n9 - No continuous spo2 monitoring and find my phone doesn’t work half of the times!\\n10 - Battery life is not upto mark as advertised.\\n\\nHonest feedback:\\n\\nNoise is only trying to copy aple smart watch from looks to accessories to watch faces, while doing that they have not done any kind of quality test or UAT.\\n\\nPlease do not fall for any positive reviews on utube as most of them are paid sponsored!\\n\\nI got frustrated and switched to Huwaei band 6, please go for that, no issues so far and runs like a butter.\\n\\nAlso as customer i dont want to buy a watch and then give that company all the sweet time to fix their issues, they should do air tight testing before selling something in the market!\\n\\nRegulators should check these kind of products as I felt cheated by purchasing this watch!\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nNoise customer support has reached out to me and they have agreed that they have bugs so gave me their complaint link PFB:\\n\\n“sir actually watch is fine but we are working on an app so that why you are facing the problem sir really sorry for that and we are trying to share you a new update of the app”\\n\\nAnd amazon has also replaced my watch but again almost same issues! :(\\n\\nSo guys noise as a brand is here to do false advertisement then take away customer’s money and invest in their new product there by leaving us here with this junkyard type product.\\n\\nAs a tech enthusiast all I can say, Please go for alternatives like huawei, mi, amazefit.

       " \"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.\\n\\nThere are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.\\n\\nApart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ve switched over from the Galaxy Watch to the Versa 2. I\\'ve been using it for a few days and I\\'m certain that this is the best \"dumb\" smartwatch on the market right now. What do I mean by \"dumb\"? I mean if you want your watch to show you notifications, track health and run a few basic apps (like Strava, Uber and Spotify in my case) then this is absolutely superb watch for you.\\n\\nThe watch looks beautiful. It\\'s not oversized, and the smoke grey coloured version which I have looks amazing to my eye. You can mix & match any Versa compatible band with this phone.\\n\\nThere are more apps available on the Fitbit app store but the variety pales in comparison to the Google UI/Samsung Wearable/Apple Watch app stores. The apps I mainly use are Uber and Spotify. Both need to work through your phone, and can\\'t work without your phone. There is no GPS inbuilt in the watch so when you call for an Uber or go for a run on Strava, you need your phone\\'s GPS connection for the apps to work. Spotify plays music through your phone, but it can be controlled via your phone. Alexa integration on the phone is quite nice - however since there\\'s no mic on the phone you have to read the responses. There are quite a few watch faces available too (several thousasnd), and I\\'m sure that\\'s only going to increase with time. One thing to note is that you can\\'t have multiple watch faces loaded on your phone and instantly switch between them on the go. Your Versa will save only 1 face at a time and every time you want to change it, it\\'ll need to be done through the Fitbit app on your phone. All notifications come on your phone - WhatsApp/Telegram/Facebook/Twitter/Instagram etc and on the messaging apps you can even reply back to the notification via your phone/Alexa. Of course, you can see who\\'s calling you and answer/decline it.\\n\\nComing to the main reason most people buy Fitbits - the health aspect. It is unparalleled when compared to the Galaxy Watch. Fitbit\\'s interface for health, constant heartrate tracking, step count are far far better than Samsung\\'s. The Fitbit App on your phone is also far more intuitive and easier to use than the eyesore that is the Samsung Wearable android app. Also there are a whole host of health apps for this watch which I haven\\'t even checked out yet - Fitbit Coach, Gold\\'s Gym AMP and many others.\\n\\nThe battery life - 7 to 8 days with constant connection to the phone, all day sync and about an hour\\'s worth of exercise everyday. Do I need to say more? Nothing else on the market even comes close.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts:\\nIf you\\'re looking for a smartwatch with a focus on health tracking, view (and reply to some) notifications and some basic access to a few apps like Strava/Uber/Spotify, this is a fantastic watch to get. You can\\'t go wrong. Battery life is phenomenal, and the Fitbit app is easier, much easier to use than the Samsungs. There are some limitations to the watch, when it comes to apps available, GPS connecitivity only via the phone and watch face selection. However, personally, even with my Galaxy Watch I found myself not using all the apps (seriously, why would I ever want to watch Youtube on my watch?). 9.5 out of 10 for me.',\n",

Most of the features work - even GPS positioning works accurately, though some what slowly.\\n\\nHowever, the watch battery failed after week 1, just after the exchange period expired. Getting it sent to service center (2 days), having them fix it (15 days), having it sent back (10 days - even though I live 5 mins from their office - because of their terrible logistics partners) meant that I could not use it for the first month at all.\\n\\nWhen I got the watch back finally, it worked for 2-3 weeks, but problem recurred - watch battery failed and it just would not charge. it would also switch off suddenly while child was wearing it, meaning you could not track your child at all. Since then, waiting for the arranged pickup for the last ten days - logistics partner only updates \"pickup failed\" each day on tracking ID. When you complain - they give you a new tracking ID as a great favour to you, which again collects the same fake updates daily.\\n\\nTwo times cant be a coincidence, and the product is useless because of battery related failures. It could have been a really nice product, but lesson learnt. Its basically a super expensive piece of plastic. Will wait to see if it even gets picked up, other wise into the dustbin it goes.',\n",
