Decent battery backup\\n3. Live mode operation is not lagging.\\n\\nCONS\\n1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.\\n2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.\\n3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.\\n4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.\\n5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk\\n6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject\\n7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.\\nI am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.\\nIn one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.\\n\\nI am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.\\nIts not worth for money\",\n",

       " 'I got this camera after seeing rave reviews in YouTube. However, this review will focus on the shortcomings only. I discovered after 10 days of use.\\n1. Poor battery life : does not last even 3 hours of use. However, this is compensated by the extra battery provided. But the way battery compartment is designed does no good to the purpose. you need to unscrew from mount to change The battery. So you will need to break your schedule in case u are shooting something continuous.\\n2. Error Error - the dreaded E:62:10 error appeared in my camera after few days of use. Although I did not face any difficulty in shooting. It did make my experience bitter. Could not resolve though the solutions available on internet. The usual switch on of. Change battery etc does not work and the error message is a part of the display now.\\n3. Mic : even tough the mic is a strong one. It does not do well to reduce background noise.\\n4. Charging time : 150 mins. This really restricts ur ability to shoot and u need to plan ahead if you are a serious vlogger.\\n5. Not weather proof. : the manual says it is not weather proof and small amounts of water may damage the internal circuits. I mean why? It restricts your ability to take outdoor shoot and a vlogger would not take this.\\n\\nApart from the above. The camera delivers what it promises in the review videos.\\n\\nUpdate :\\nMy lens assembly was faulty. Thankfully Sony service centre was open and as directed by the Sony representative, I gave the camera for repair. It took 14 days to get the part from abroad and complete the repairs. Now, the camera is working fine. No issues as such.\\nUpdate 2: Please go through the settings and understand each setting before shooting. There are a lot of helpful YouTube videos on this camera.\\nUpdate 3 : The camera worked fine for 2 days after repairs. As of now it is still in the repair shop. 2 months after purchase the camera is 28 days.(and counting) in repair shop. Even after 2 trips of repair shop the error does not go away. Now it is a permanent display in my camera.\\nUpdate 4: Sony had finally replaced the camera with a new one. Will update if there are issues in the new one. From mid September to mid December the camera was in the repair centre for at least 50 days before it was finally replaced.',\n",

And I must recommend this camera if you want to capture birds or insects or even butterflies. Zoom feature is simply superb and can capture distant objects at ease. Image stabilization is good within 65x zoom limit. If you want to go beyond that, I suggest buying tripod or gorilla pods. Learning the various modes is so easy and camera adjusts most of the things for you like there is auto for every setting.

       " 'I\\'ve had an X-T3 for a couple of years, and before that had an X100F. The latter was my favorite camera ever, but I felt too limited by the fixed lens. The X-E4 - which I bought as a second camera - is pretty close to that X100 experience: it\\'s smaller and lighter than the X-T3, but has the same sensor and image quality. Some people may not like the lack of buttons and dials on the device; if you spend a lot of time fiddling with your camera, then this might not be for you. I don\\'t fiddle much: I generally shoot in aperture priority, and make very few changes when I\\'m shooting.\\n\\nOne thing to bear in mind is that with the small size of this camera, you might not find it easy to use with a large lens. I find this is great for the smaller prime lenses - the f2 and f2.8 \"Fujicrons\" - but it\\'s unbalanced with a larger lens, like the 16-80mm zoom. The 18-55mm zoom lens is okay, but anything larger means you might struggle against the camera. And, if you plan to use larger, heavier lenses, you probably want to get the additional grip.\\n\\nAll in all, this may become my favorite camera ever, superseding the X100F. With the new 27mm lens, available as the \"kit\" lens with this camera, it is pocketable, and it\\'s almost as small and light as the X100 series.',\n",

Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.\\n\\n1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.\\n\\n2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it’s hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.\\n\\n3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There’s a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.\\n\\n4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there’s a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.\\n\\n5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there’s a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.\\n\\n6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.\\n\\n7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.\\n\\n8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don’t feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.\\n\\n- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.\\n\\n- At such a high price point Fujifilm should’ve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.\\n\\nIn case you’ve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.\\n\\nP.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard-earned money gets its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to mail me for any queries and follow me for more such informative reviews.\",\n",

       " \"An entirely capable Mirrorless camera from Sony who presented this camera as an 'Entry Level' Full Frame camera. It gives you features which most professional DSLR's cannot give, all for a body MRP of below 2 lakhs. My review about every segment of this camera:\\n\\n1- Body: Sony claims that the body is Magnesium Alloy which is only dust proof and splash proof, so you might wanna reconsider if you are going to be shooting in heavy rain or very unlikely conditions, which most of us won't be. The buttons on the back feels nice and clicky, with Sony following the same button layout as in the Sony A7R3, which was praised by photographers a lot.\\n\\n2- Performance and AF: It does a whopping 10 frame per second shooting with both Mechanical and electronic shutter, and has the same Autofocus system in the Sony A9, which is a 3 lakh INR camera! This is insane! The interesting part is, the AF points cover about 93% of the screen, so it is a great feature to have while recording video. It also has the legendary Eye-AF, which was introduced in the A7R3, and works like a charm. One thing though, is that you can't use Eye-AF while recording video, it is applicable only for photography.\\n\\n3- Photography and Video Features: It has a 24MP Backlit CMOS sensor, which means that it should have better low light performance since it is backlit. And yes, it does! The low light performance even outruns the A7R3, and this camera. is a beast in low light! Taking portraits should be easier since it has the Eye AF, and it is very much ideal for photography of fast moving subjects. The Autofocus tracking is absolutely wonderful, and if you're using native Sony lenses, then you shouldn't have any problems at all. Another advantage is the crop mode in this camera, which only utilises the APS-C size of the sensor. You can still attach your crop sensor lenses and still get awesome stills and video without any Vignetting.\\nThe movie recording capabilities of this camera blows most of the pro-DSLR's out of the water. 4K 30fps, and 1080p upto 120fps. And the quality of the footage looks much more improvised when comparing it to older models like the A6300. You get all the Professional Picture Profiles in Video as well!\\n\\n4- Battery Life: Since Sony is using the new Z-series batteries for this camera, battery life is significantly improved. I could shoot for a whole day(both clips and stills) and still had 30% battery at the end of the day. It's good to have one more battery though.\\n\\n5. Who is it for: Well, for the features it offers, it definitely is a Pro camera. But at this price point, it can be used by anyone who wants a Full Frame Camera to start off! It is absolutely a Bang for the Buck camera(if only more) and it is a pleasure carrying it around and shooting with it! If you are a landscape photographer and wants more Megapixels than 24MP for cropping in, then I would suggest the A7R3 or even the A7R2! The A7R2 is still a very capable camera with similar features, but terrible battery life and average AF capability. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE SONY A73 TO ABSOLUTELY ANYONE WHO HAS AN INTEREST AND THE BUDGET TO BUY THIS CAMERA!\\n\\nENJOY THE CAMERA! YOU ARE GONNA BUY YOURSELF A BEAST!\",\n",

If you want still photographs then the DSLR is what you want. This camera has the added perk of taking photos, but the main focus of this is video content sharing.\\n\\n*The highlight of this camera is the ease of use. You really don\\'t need to know technical things like which aperture to choose, which ISO or shutter speed, it does everything for you. It has auto focus (which is much better than on DSLRs) and the flip screen makes it easy to monitor yourself while you\\'re recording.\\n\\n*The size of this makes it far superior to a DSLR. This thing is *tiny* and so lightweight. If you get the accessory kit with the wireless grip/tripod, you are good to go. This is especially good if you vlog while walking or need to be active when speaking to the camera.\\n\\n*Has slow-mo capability, time-lapse, bluetooth and wifi.\\n\\n*Benefits over just a regular \\'ol smartphone: The image sensor on this is much bigger and better. With image sensors, the adage is \"the bigger the better\" which is why DSLR cameras have such an advantage (but they\\'re also too big to lug around) This makes your image quality much higher. The microphone on this is also way better too. (With the DSLR, you would need to buy a separate mic.) You are free to buy a separate mic with this camera as well but the mic that it comes with is pretty good right out of the box.\\n\\n*Things that could be improved: The software it comes with is rather limited. Especially for editing videos, though on the plus side, you may not need to do too much editing if you are the type that just does your vlogging in one continuous take.\\n\\n*The lenses are built in/ not interchangeable. This is good in that you have everything you need at all times, but bad if you scratched/cracked your lens you would need to buy a whole new camera.\\n\\n*There\\'s no flash - this shouldn\\'t be an issue for vloggers though.

It wasn\\'t great but I\\'ve seen other cameras perform worse. If you feel like you\\'re going to be having long sessions, I would consider getting a second battery just in case.\\n\\nOverall, I think this is a great and versatile camera for those who vlog or create video content.

       " \"The XT-200 is typically a successor of Fujifilm’s entry-level mirrorless camera XT-100 which was launched more than a year ago and its pricing sits just below the mid-ranger XT-30. Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.\\n\\n1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.\\n\\n2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it’s hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.\\n\\n3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There’s a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.\\n\\n4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there’s a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.\\n\\n5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there’s a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.\\n\\n6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.\\n\\n7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.\\n\\n8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don’t feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.\\n\\n- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.\\n\\n- At such a high price point Fujifilm should’ve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.\\n\\nIn case you’ve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.\\n\\nP.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard-earned money gets its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to mail me for any queries and follow me for more such informative reviews.\",\n",

       " \"I had been looking for a good camera for under Rs 1 lakh for sometime when Fujifilm launched this camera last year and it immediately became a hot favourite of several camera review forums/channels. From a value for money perspective, I think this camera has no competition in the market if you try to find a feature to feature match for this price. From a cost to performance perspective it gets even better. This is a very capable camera. In a few days that I have spent with it, I have found myself pleasantly surprised multiple times by the quality of images that it produces and I am not even talking about the quality of raw files here. I know that relying on SOOC JPEGs may not be a feasible option for a lot of people. However I think if you are so inclined, this is the camera that fits the bill. This is a fairly advanced camera and it is heavily customizable. And although it is very easy to get your photos out of it and into a smartphone, you can't expect the workflow to be the same as a smartphone camera. But then again, the image quality you get is light years ahead of what the best smartphone cameras can do. I bought it without the kit lens and paired it with the cheap xc35mm f2 prime and so far I'm loving it.\",\n",

Some people may not like the lack of buttons and dials on the device; if you spend a lot of time fiddling with your camera, then this might not be for you. I don\\'t fiddle much: I generally shoot in aperture priority, and make very few changes when I\\'m shooting.\\n\\nOne thing to bear in mind is that with the small size of this camera, you might not find it easy to use with a large lens.

The 18-55mm zoom lens is okay, but anything larger means you might struggle against the camera. And, if you plan to use larger, heavier lenses, you probably want to get the additional grip.\\n\\nAll in all, this may become my favorite camera ever, superseding the X100F.

       " \"The XT-200 is typically a successor of Fujifilm’s entry-level mirrorless camera XT-100 which was launched more than a year ago and its pricing sits just below the mid-ranger XT-30. Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.\\n\\n1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.\\n\\n2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it’s hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.\\n\\n3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There’s a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.\\n\\n4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there’s a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.\\n\\n5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there’s a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.\\n\\n6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.\\n\\n7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.\\n\\n8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don’t feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.\\n\\n- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.\\n\\n- At such a high price point Fujifilm should’ve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.\\n\\nIn case you’ve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.\\n\\nP.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard-earned money gets its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to mail me for any queries and follow me for more such informative reviews.\",\n",

       " 'I got this camera after seeing rave reviews in YouTube. However, this review will focus on the shortcomings only. I discovered after 10 days of use.\\n1. Poor battery life : does not last even 3 hours of use. However, this is compensated by the extra battery provided. But the way battery compartment is designed does no good to the purpose. you need to unscrew from mount to change The battery. So you will need to break your schedule in case u are shooting something continuous.\\n2. Error Error - the dreaded E:62:10 error appeared in my camera after few days of use.

And I must recommend this camera if you want to capture birds or insects or even butterflies. Zoom feature is simply superb and can capture distant objects at ease. Image stabilization is good within 65x zoom limit. If you want to go beyond that, I suggest buying tripod or gorilla pods. Learning the various modes is so easy and camera adjusts most of the things for you like there is auto for every setting. Finally, if you love birds and tiny objects, this camera by canon is my first suggestion. I am satisfied with its performance in this price range. The only drawback is battery life. I felt charging it quite frequently. But the rest is perfect.',\n",
