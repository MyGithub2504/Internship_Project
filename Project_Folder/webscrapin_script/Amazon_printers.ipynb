A wonderful multifunction device with laser printing.\\n2. Detailed control panel with 2 line LCD text display\\n3. Good print & scan speed/resolution.

Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.\\nIf already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.\\n\\n1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.\\n2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.\\n3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.\\n4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.\\n5. Now when you run HP scan utility, it will be able to communicate to MFP via Wi-Fi.\\n6. If you skip step 3 above, it won’t work and give communication error.\\n\\n▶ WITH WPS\\n\\n1. Power on MFP. USB or LAN cable is not required.\\n2. Press the Wi-Fi button on MFP to start the WPS connection.\\n3. Push the WPS button on your router.\\n4. Let it connect to the router. Once successful, the IP address will be displayed on LCD.\\n5. Now start setup and select 2nd option 'connect through the network'. It will search for the printer on the network.\\n6. Once found, select it and proceed.\\n\\n•••••••••••••••••••\\nFINAL VERDICT\\n•••••••••••••••••••\\nI am using it for more than a year and it never disappointed me in terms of usage, be it printing/scanning/copy task.\\n\\n▶ This device, M126nw is highly suitable for general home usage where you don’t print every day or light to medium office work where you print/scan daily. You can very well go for it.\\n\\n▶ There used to be another model m126a without network capability. If you can find it, you can save some bucks. But a few bucks more get you a good deal of value proposition with m126nw.\",\n",

       " 'TL;DR: If you\\'re looking for an economical printer for your home, or small office (with low printing requirements), just buy this model.\\n\\nFirst of all, I use HP GT5820 (Ink-tank) printer at office, and I\\'m sure that a lot of people are wondering whether they should purchase the GT5820 or the 4729. So let\\'s compare them:\\n\\nEconomy: Prints on the GT5820 basically cost nothing. Because of the massive ink capacity and the low cost, the cost of ink in a print is negligible. For the GT5820, cost of paper per print tends to be greater than the ink. The 4729 is much more expensive than the 5820 when compared in absolute terms. However, cartridges of 4729 are rated at 1500 & 750 pages (Black & Colour, respectively), at 5% coverage. I received four cartridges (total) when I purchased from Amazon, so I got one \"free\" set. This is the largest (by far) cartridge capacity of any conventional printer available in India, and the cartridges are also some of the cheapest. You should also keep in mind that each cartridge comes with its own dedicated print-head. This is an important point so I\\'ll speak more about this later.\\n\\nPrint quality: The 4729 is significantly better at printing photos than the 5820. Photo prints on the 4729 are crisp, detailed, and the colour is accurate, whereas photo prints on the 5820 appear dull by comparison. However, the worst part of printing photos on the 5820 was that the print output was extremely prone to smudging (on glossy paper). Something about the inks on the 5820 cause them not to be dry once they\\'re out of the printer - touching the page would lead to smudging and transfer of ink to your fingertips. Note that I used identical Kodak photo papers to test this on the 4729 and the conventional cartridge model exhibited zero smudging - the print was dry as soon as the paper left the printer. However, the 5820 is excellent at printing text and business graphics on MATTE paper. This property of the 5820 leads me to conclude that it is suitable mainly for business use, where you\\'re likely going to use it to print on matte paper, and mostly for business graphics. where smudging like this will not occur.\\n\\nMaintenance: On the 4729, when you change a cartridge, you\\'re changing one of the most important components of the printer - the print-head, so if a print-head gets clogged, you can just buy a new cartridge for Rs. 600-800 and get \"as-good-as-new\" performance. Clogged print-heads are one of the most common issues Inkjet printers face - and it happens when a printer is left unused for long periods of time - something that can happen in a home / small office. The 5820, on the other hand, has a fixed print-head which will require servicing if such an issue occurs. I couldn\\'t find the cost replacement print head for the GT5820 online. If you print every day, then this will probably not be an issue for you on either printer.

       " 'TL;DR: If you\\'re looking for an economical printer for your home, or small office (with low printing requirements), just buy this model.\\n\\nFirst of all, I use HP GT5820 (Ink-tank) printer at office, and I\\'m sure that a lot of people are wondering whether they should purchase the GT5820 or the 4729. So let\\'s compare them:\\n\\nEconomy: Prints on the GT5820 basically cost nothing. Because of the massive ink capacity and the low cost, the cost of ink in a print is negligible. For the GT5820, cost of paper per print tends to be greater than the ink. The 4729 is much more expensive than the 5820 when compared in absolute terms. However, cartridges of 4729 are rated at 1500 & 750 pages (Black & Colour, respectively), at 5% coverage. I received four cartridges (total) when I purchased from Amazon, so I got one \"free\" set. This is the largest (by far) cartridge capacity of any conventional printer available in India, and the cartridges are also some of the cheapest. You should also keep in mind that each cartridge comes with its own dedicated print-head. This is an important point so I\\'ll speak more about this later.\\n\\nPrint quality: The 4729 is significantly better at printing photos than the 5820. Photo prints on the 4729 are crisp, detailed, and the colour is accurate, whereas photo prints on the 5820 appear dull by comparison. However, the worst part of printing photos on the 5820 was that the print output was extremely prone to smudging (on glossy paper). Something about the inks on the 5820 cause them not to be dry once they\\'re out of the printer - touching the page would lead to smudging and transfer of ink to your fingertips. Note that I used identical Kodak photo papers to test this on the 4729 and the conventional cartridge model exhibited zero smudging - the print was dry as soon as the paper left the printer. However, the 5820 is excellent at printing text and business graphics on MATTE paper. This property of the 5820 leads me to conclude that it is suitable mainly for business use, where you\\'re likely going to use it to print on matte paper, and mostly for business graphics. where smudging like this will not occur.\\n\\nMaintenance: On the 4729, when you change a cartridge, you\\'re changing one of the most important components of the printer - the print-head, so if a print-head gets clogged, you can just buy a new cartridge for Rs. 600-800 and get \"as-good-as-new\" performance. Clogged print-heads are one of the most common issues Inkjet printers face - and it happens when a printer is left unused for long periods of time - something that can happen in a home / small office. The 5820, on the other hand, has a fixed print-head which will require servicing if such an issue occurs. I couldn\\'t find the cost replacement print head for the GT5820 online. If you print every day, then this will probably not be an issue for you on either printer.

       " \"This is truly the best All-in-One monochrome laser printer in the market. I've been using a laser printer for almost 6 years now. Earlier my printer was Canon MF3010 with which I wasn't satisfied at all as the print quality was very light and after a couple of print, the colour got even lighter. Also, the refilling cost was around ₹700-800, so after using that printer for many years I was looking for another great printer for my home office. This time I needed a printer which has network printing capability, duplex printing, Google Cloud Printing and low maintenance/colour cost. Initially, I thought I would get an HP printer but none of them had all the features I was looking for and I will never buy Canon again in my life.\\nSo, after researching a lot I came across this Brother DCP-B7535DW printer which had everything that I needed. So, I started checking out reviews and finally decided to buy it. I bought it from my local Brother Distributer at ₹16,400/- whereas on Amazon it is being priced at ₹19,792/-. In fact, I also checked the price of this printer during Prime Day sale and the price was the same. Hence, I bought it from my local Brother distributor from way cheaper price than Amazon or any other online store.\\nHere are some TL;DR for the printer:\\nPros:\\n1. The printer has a super high printing speed.\\n2. Print quality is truly amazing\\n3. Cost of toner is about ₹650/- (Local Brother Distributor Price) which is cheaper than refilling while using the genuine product\\n4. Cost of the drum is around ₹1450/- (local distributor price) which you only need to change after 15,000 page print\\n5. The LCD is backlit, so you can see it in a dark environment too.\\n6. ADF is quite accurate and fast as well.\\n7. Print, scan, copy all are super fast. I scanned a page at 1200 dpi which took 15 sec to complete. Amazing.\\n8. Supports Google Cloud Print, which I'm enjoying a lot\\n9. Network Printing works flawlessly.\\n10. Printer shows ink low reminder when needed\\n11. All the software & firmware are always up to date. Brother do provide software support and update their drivers, firmware and software, which you can easily update using the Brother software. Even HP, Canon doesn't do that.\\n12.

The upfront payment maybe a little high, but the features you are getting and the amazing printing quality along with low toner cost, trust me, in the long run, you will benefit from it.

       " 'TL;DR: If you\\'re looking for an economical printer for your home, or small office (with low printing requirements), just buy this model.\\n\\nFirst of all, I use HP GT5820 (Ink-tank) printer at office, and I\\'m sure that a lot of people are wondering whether they should purchase the GT5820 or the 4729. So let\\'s compare them:\\n\\nEconomy: Prints on the GT5820 basically cost nothing. Because of the massive ink capacity and the low cost, the cost of ink in a print is negligible. For the GT5820, cost of paper per print tends to be greater than the ink. The 4729 is much more expensive than the 5820 when compared in absolute terms. However, cartridges of 4729 are rated at 1500 & 750 pages (Black & Colour, respectively), at 5% coverage. I received four cartridges (total) when I purchased from Amazon, so I got one \"free\" set. This is the largest (by far) cartridge capacity of any conventional printer available in India, and the cartridges are also some of the cheapest. You should also keep in mind that each cartridge comes with its own dedicated print-head. This is an important point so I\\'ll speak more about this later.\\n\\nPrint quality: The 4729 is significantly better at printing photos than the 5820. Photo prints on the 4729 are crisp, detailed, and the colour is accurate, whereas photo prints on the 5820 appear dull by comparison. However, the worst part of printing photos on the 5820 was that the print output was extremely prone to smudging (on glossy paper). Something about the inks on the 5820 cause them not to be dry once they\\'re out of the printer - touching the page would lead to smudging and transfer of ink to your fingertips. Note that I used identical Kodak photo papers to test this on the 4729 and the conventional cartridge model exhibited zero smudging - the print was dry as soon as the paper left the printer. However, the 5820 is excellent at printing text and business graphics on MATTE paper. This property of the 5820 leads me to conclude that it is suitable mainly for business use, where you\\'re likely going to use it to print on matte paper, and mostly for business graphics. where smudging like this will not occur.\\n\\nMaintenance: On the 4729, when you change a cartridge, you\\'re changing one of the most important components of the printer - the print-head, so if a print-head gets clogged, you can just buy a new cartridge for Rs. 600-800 and get \"as-good-as-new\" performance. Clogged print-heads are one of the most common issues Inkjet printers face - and it happens when a printer is left unused for long periods of time - something that can happen in a home / small office. The 5820, on the other hand, has a fixed print-head which will require servicing if such an issue occurs. I couldn\\'t find the cost replacement print head for the GT5820 online. If you print every day, then this will probably not be an issue for you on either printer. This was a key decider for me because I expect that my home printer will get used once a week at most.\\n\\nEase of use: Both the 4729 and 5820 have nearly identical features. Both have wireless functionality that was easy to set up and use (SEE UPDATE BELOW), and work reliably (at least on Windows - OSX can be a bit iffy, but still doable). Scanner units appear to be identical, and work with native scanning apps over wireless.\\n\\nSo finally, let\\'s do a round-up:\\n\\n4729\\n+ Pro: Excellent print quality on matte and glossy papers.\\n+ Pro: Cheap cartridges with yield that is much higher than all competition.\\n+ Pro: Cartridges are easily replaced, and transportation / moving of printer is easy.\\n- Con: Much more expensive for large workloads, compared to GT5820.\\n\\n5820\\n+ Pro: Inks cost basically nothing per print. You cannot get cheaper prints than this.\\n+ Pro: Excellent print quality on MATTE papers for text and business graphics.\\n- Con: Terrible smudging issue on image prints on glossy paper (at max quality setting). Unsuitable for printing photos.\\n\\nSo I\\'d say that for business use, you should get the 5820, and for home use, the 4729. I\\'ve looked at pretty much every other printer available on the market and these two appear to be the best options.\\n\\nUPDATE: I\\'ve taken a star off because of unreliable wireless connectivity. Basically, once you\\'ve set up the wireless connection, there\\'s no guarantee that the printer will continue to work reliably. On Windows, it\\'s pretty much necessary to install the official drivers before setting up the printer. On a Windows laptop, I had to delete the printer configuration and allow Windows to set it up again on its own to get it to work properly. So yeah, I guess the wireless feature on printers is hit or miss. If you plan to use this printer with multiple devices via wireless, your experience can be iffy.',\n",

Basically, once you\\'ve set up the wireless connection, there\\'s no guarantee that the printer will continue to work reliably. On Windows, it\\'s pretty much necessary to install the official drivers before setting up the printer. On a Windows laptop, I had to delete the printer configuration and allow Windows to set it up again on its own to get it to work properly. So yeah, I guess the wireless feature on printers is hit or miss. If you plan to use this printer with multiple devices via wireless, your experience can be iffy.',\n",

       " \"I was looking for good quality MFP in the 10k range and came across this model. HP name and its features were eye-catcher and I was able to finalize it soon.\\n\\nI am using this MFP for more than a year and so far had no issues, be it printing or scanning or copier. P.S. I use only genuine HP toner in it, so it’s quite a deal.\\n\\nHP 126nw, mark this nw in its name as it makes it super useful, giving it network capability in terms of LAN/Wi-Fi for both printing and scanning. This is really useful as you can keep it anywhere and print from virtually any location without any cable connected (other than power cable).\\n\\nSetting it up, in general, is a breeze while the Wi-Fi scan is a bit complicated. I will list the steps to make it easy for you.\\nFYI, I got it from Cambium Retail seller.\\n\\n•••••••••••••••\\nINSIDE BOX\\n•••••••••••••••\\n1. Printer\\n2. Paper stack tray\\n3. Print collection tray\\n4. Introductory cartridge\\n- Pre-installed, (you need to remove orange clip & pull the orange tab to remove the seal, before usage, pic attached)\\n- Yields approx 550 pages\\n5. Power cable\\n6. USB cable\\n7. Getting Started, Installation, Warranty & User guide\\n8. Printer CD\\n\\n•••••••••••••••••••\\nABOUT DEVICE\\n•••••••••••••••••••\\nDimensions: L x W x H 420 x 365 x 254 mm\\nWeight: ~8 kg\\n\\nPrint Quality: 10/10\\nScan Quality: 8/10\\nPower Consumption: 9/10\\nPrint Cost: 7/10 (wrt genuine cartridge, not wrt compatible, duplicate or refilled ones)\\nBuild Quality: 9/10\\n\\nApprox cost per page (using genuine cartridge): Rs 3\\nThere's a huge drop in cost if local ones are used, but those have far inferior print quality (you can easily scratch and remove print) & damages rollers inside.\\n\\n•••••••\\nPROS\\n•••••••\\n1. A wonderful multifunction device with laser printing.\\n2. Detailed control panel with 2 line LCD text display\\n3. Good print & scan speed/resolution. Print (up to 20ppm, 1200 dpi) & scan (up to 7ppm b/w, 5ppm colour, 1200 dpi).\\n4. Multiple connectivity options for print/scan. USB/LAN/Wi-Fi.\\n5. Set up anywhere, thanks to its Wi-Fi connectivity. Just a power source required.\\n5. Print using smartphone directly via Wi-Di i.e. Smartphone → Printer\\n6. Print using smartphone via network i.e. Smartphone → Router → Printer (Download HP print service plugin from app store)\\n8. It can be used as a standalone photocopy machine using the control panel with an extra double side photocopy feature for ID cards etc.\\n9. All photocopy related controls are available on panel, like one-touch photocopy button, no of copies, light-dark with 11 steps, reduce/enlarge, optimization, paper setting, etc\\n10. Tiltable control panel for easy access.\\n11. The good thing with a laser printer is that you don’t have to worry about drying ink or print head. I had 2 heads replaced in the earlier inkjet printer. So even if off for a month, laser one works instantly with the same good quality.\\n\\n••••••••\\nCONS\\n••••••••\\n1. Scan quality is not crisp. On full zoom, I find it slightly blurry. But in regular day to day scanning tasks, you won’t even notice it. So not a big deal.\\n2. No backlit LCD and it’s a pain to operate it without backlight unless you tilt it.\\n3. No ADF for scanning, so you need feed in every single page to be scanned separately. (But you can’t get everything in this range)\\n4. Initial warm-up time (power on to ready) is quite large, ~40 sec.\\n\\n•••••••••••••\\nFEATURES\\n•••••••••••••\\n-Extensive control panel on the front\\n-Web panel/local network page accessible via IP address. You can find just everything here, supply status, network settings, paper setting, web services, power options, logs, reports, etc, etc\\n-USB printing/ scanning (via USB 2.0)\\n-LAN/ Wi-Fi Printing/Scanning (via Ethernet 10/100, Wi-Fi 802.11b/gnew line)\\n-Apple Air print\\n-Printing via Email or HP ePrint\\n-Printing directly via Mobile using Wi-Di\\n-Duplex printing support\\n-Standalone photocopy with id copy mode & options like reduce enlarge, light/dark, mode, etc\\n-Scan to email/application/file\\n-Multiple scan formats supported like pdf, tiff, jpg, bmp, png\\n\\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\nINITIAL SETUP (via USB cable or WiFi or LAN)\\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\n1. Remove various seals from around MFP.\\n2. Take out the cartridge from MFP and remove the orange clip & pull orange tab to remove the seal. Reinstall it.\\n3. Attach power cable.\\n4. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.\\n5. Follow on-screen instructions for the desired setup.\\n- USB based\\n- Connect through network\\n- First-time wireless connection\\n\\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\nCONFIGURING IT FOR WIRELESS SCANNING & PRINTING BOTH\\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\n▶ WITHOUT WPS\\n\\nThe initial setup of this MFP directly via 'first-time wireless connection' option, does not enable scan via Wi-Fi. Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.\\nIf already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.\\n\\n1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.\\n2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.\\n3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.\\n4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.\\n5.

       " \"I love this printer. This is the 316 All in one. It doesnot have wifi,so it's not a wireless printer. But the best part is that you can buy a small connector OTG for connecting your android phone with this printer, download the HP Print Service Plugin app on your phone and get to printing directly from the phone. The print quality is good. The print outs don't come out at the same speed as they come out of a laserjet black and white printer ( i also have a Ricoh black and white printer/scanner/copier). One coloured print out takes almost 40-50 seconds. It's small in size and the coloured bottles come along with the printer. The 310,316,319 series is a series of non wireless printers with not much difference in their functions but instead difference in the amount of colour bottles given with them. The 410 series is truly wireless and you can buy those only if you have much use of a coloured printer daily and you want to invest over 10000 bucks. You need to take a printout once or twice every week for the printer ink to not dry. I have been using this for almost a month now and it has been working wonderfully. The only thing i have been not been able to resolve is that i can print not directly from my Gallery of phone but i have to use Google Photos app to get the print option. I got this for 8100 rs in prime day sale so it's totally worth it.. delivery was smooth and fast and the printer was received in very fine condition. Good job Amazon.\\n\\nEdit after 2 months of use: The printer started showing paper jam error. We followed the instructions on the HP page to resolve the problem but there wasn't any paper jam anywhere. Called the customer care number after sign in with the email id and they promptly sent an engineer to resolve the issue.( In actual the cartridge was jammed.) He told us the paper roller is not working,placed an order immediately and within 2 days the new part was put in the printer, with the printer working properly again. So full marks to HP for their customer service, although I didn't expect the printer to develop a snag when we have been using it very carefully.\",\n",

       " 'TL;DR: If you\\'re looking for an economical printer for your home, or small office (with low printing requirements), just buy this model.\\n\\nFirst of all, I use HP GT5820 (Ink-tank) printer at office, and I\\'m sure that a lot of people are wondering whether they should purchase the GT5820 or the 4729. So let\\'s compare them:\\n\\nEconomy: Prints on the GT5820 basically cost nothing. Because of the massive ink capacity and the low cost, the cost of ink in a print is negligible. For the GT5820, cost of paper per print tends to be greater than the ink. The 4729 is much more expensive than the 5820 when compared in absolute terms. However, cartridges of 4729 are rated at 1500 & 750 pages (Black & Colour, respectively), at 5% coverage. I received four cartridges (total) when I purchased from Amazon, so I got one \"free\" set. This is the largest (by far) cartridge capacity of any conventional printer available in India, and the cartridges are also some of the cheapest. You should also keep in mind that each cartridge comes with its own dedicated print-head. This is an important point so I\\'ll speak more about this later.\\n\\nPrint quality: The 4729 is significantly better at printing photos than the 5820. Photo prints on the 4729 are crisp, detailed, and the colour is accurate, whereas photo prints on the 5820 appear dull by comparison. However, the worst part of printing photos on the 5820 was that the print output was extremely prone to smudging (on glossy paper). Something about the inks on the 5820 cause them not to be dry once they\\'re out of the printer - touching the page would lead to smudging and transfer of ink to your fingertips. Note that I used identical Kodak photo papers to test this on the 4729 and the conventional cartridge model exhibited zero smudging - the print was dry as soon as the paper left the printer. However, the 5820 is excellent at printing text and business graphics on MATTE paper. This property of the 5820 leads me to conclude that it is suitable mainly for business use, where you\\'re likely going to use it to print on matte paper, and mostly for business graphics. where smudging like this will not occur.\\n\\nMaintenance: On the 4729, when you change a cartridge, you\\'re changing one of the most important components of the printer - the print-head, so if a print-head gets clogged, you can just buy a new cartridge for Rs. 600-800 and get \"as-good-as-new\" performance. Clogged print-heads are one of the most common issues Inkjet printers face - and it happens when a printer is left unused for long periods of time - something that can happen in a home / small office. The 5820, on the other hand, has a fixed print-head which will require servicing if such an issue occurs. I couldn\\'t find the cost replacement print head for the GT5820 online. If you print every day, then this will probably not be an issue for you on either printer. This was a key decider for me because I expect that my home printer will get used once a week at most.\\n\\nEase of use: Both the 4729 and 5820 have nearly identical features. Both have wireless functionality that was easy to set up and use (SEE UPDATE BELOW), and work reliably (at least on Windows - OSX can be a bit iffy, but still doable). Scanner units appear to be identical, and work with native scanning apps over wireless.\\n\\nSo finally, let\\'s do a round-up:\\n\\n4729\\n+ Pro: Excellent print quality on matte and glossy papers.\\n+ Pro: Cheap cartridges with yield that is much higher than all competition.\\n+ Pro: Cartridges are easily replaced, and transportation / moving of printer is easy.\\n- Con: Much more expensive for large workloads, compared to GT5820.\\n\\n5820\\n+ Pro: Inks cost basically nothing per print. You cannot get cheaper prints than this.\\n+ Pro: Excellent print quality on MATTE papers for text and business graphics.\\n- Con: Terrible smudging issue on image prints on glossy paper (at max quality setting). Unsuitable for printing photos.\\n\\nSo I\\'d say that for business use, you should get the 5820, and for home use, the 4729. I\\'ve looked at pretty much every other printer available on the market and these two appear to be the best options.\\n\\nUPDATE: I\\'ve taken a star off because of unreliable wireless connectivity. Basically, once you\\'ve set up the wireless connection, there\\'s no guarantee that the printer will continue to work reliably. On Windows, it\\'s pretty much necessary to install the official drivers before setting up the printer. On a Windows laptop, I had to delete the printer configuration and allow Windows to set it up again on its own to get it to work properly. So yeah, I guess the wireless feature on printers is hit or miss. If you plan to use this printer with multiple devices via wireless, your experience can be iffy.',\n",

However, cartridges of 4729 are rated at 1500 & 750 pages (Black & Colour, respectively), at 5% coverage. I received four cartridges (total) when I purchased from Amazon, so I got one \"free\" set. This is the largest (by far) cartridge capacity of any conventional printer available in India, and the cartridges are also some of the cheapest. You should also keep in mind that each cartridge comes with its own dedicated print-head. This is an important point so I\\'ll speak more about this later.\\n\\nPrint quality: The 4729 is significantly better at printing photos than the 5820. Photo prints on the 4729 are crisp, detailed, and the colour is accurate, whereas photo prints on the 5820 appear dull by comparison. However, the worst part of printing photos on the 5820 was that the print output was extremely prone to smudging (on glossy paper). Something about the inks on the 5820 cause them not to be dry once they\\'re out of the printer - touching the page would lead to smudging and transfer of ink to your fingertips. Note that I used identical Kodak photo papers to test this on the 4729 and the conventional cartridge model exhibited zero smudging - the print was dry as soon as the paper left the printer. However, the 5820 is excellent at printing text and business graphics on MATTE paper. This property of the 5820 leads me to conclude that it is suitable mainly for business use, where you\\'re likely going to use it to print on matte paper, and mostly for business graphics. where smudging like this will not occur.\\n\\nMaintenance: On the 4729, when you change a cartridge, you\\'re changing one of the most important components of the printer - the print-head, so if a print-head gets clogged, you can just buy a new cartridge for Rs. 600-800 and get \"as-good-as-new\" performance. Clogged print-heads are one of the most common issues Inkjet printers face - and it happens when a printer is left unused for long periods of time - something that can happen in a home / small office. The 5820, on the other hand, has a fixed print-head which will require servicing if such an issue occurs. I couldn\\'t find the cost replacement print head for the GT5820 online. If you print every day, then this will probably not be an issue for you on either printer. This was a key decider for me because I expect that my home printer will get used once a week at most.\\n\\nEase of use: Both the 4729 and 5820 have nearly identical features. Both have wireless functionality that was easy to set up and use (SEE UPDATE BELOW), and work reliably (at least on Windows - OSX can be a bit iffy, but still doable). Scanner units appear to be identical, and work with native scanning apps over wireless.\\n\\nSo finally, let\\'s do a round-up:\\n\\n4729\\n+ Pro: Excellent print quality on matte and glossy papers.\\n+ Pro: Cheap cartridges with yield that is much higher than all competition.\\n+ Pro: Cartridges are easily replaced, and transportation / moving of printer is easy.\\n- Con: Much more expensive for large workloads, compared to GT5820.\\n\\n5820\\n+ Pro: Inks cost basically nothing per print. You cannot get cheaper prints than this.\\n+ Pro: Excellent print quality on MATTE papers for text and business graphics.\\n- Con: Terrible smudging issue on image prints on glossy paper (at max quality setting). Unsuitable for printing photos.\\n\\nSo I\\'d say that for business use, you should get the 5820, and for home use, the 4729. I\\'ve looked at pretty much every other printer available on the market and these two appear to be the best options.\\n\\nUPDATE: I\\'ve taken a star off because of unreliable wireless connectivity. Basically, once you\\'ve set up the wireless connection, there\\'s no guarantee that the printer will continue to work reliably. On Windows, it\\'s pretty much necessary to install the official drivers before setting up the printer. On a Windows laptop, I had to delete the printer configuration and allow Windows to set it up again on its own to get it to work properly. So yeah, I guess the wireless feature on printers is hit or miss. If you plan to use this printer with multiple devices via wireless, your experience can be iffy.',\n",
       " 'TL;DR: If you\\'re looking for an economical printer for your home, or small office (with low printing requirements), just buy this model.\\n\\nFirst of all, I use HP GT5820 (Ink-tank) printer at office, and I\\'m sure that a lot of people are wondering whether they should purchase the GT5820 or the 4729.

       " 'REVIEW AFTER 6 MONTHS OF USE: Oh this printer is stupendous!!! It deserves an 8 star!!!\\n\\nI printed a photo last week (on Epson gloss paper) and it came 100% studio quality. Well, thats enough for me! I can now make posters at home, without spending extra bucks in a studio. Love it. buy it!!\\n----------------------\\nLet me first say, that the 5-star rating I have given is not because L130 is the best feature-packed printer in the market, but rather it was the “exact” printer I wanted per my technical requirement, specification, and budget---after a 2 month research.\\n\\nI am going to give a very detailed review, with some myth-busters. Yes, I see a lot of wrong Q&As and reviews that I would like to bust with my honest review on day-3 of my purchase.\\n\\nHome use, not for bulk or fast printing–This printer is a pure home or small business/shop use. Do not expect paper capacity beyond 40-50 (75 GSM) in the input tray. Print speed is fast enough for home and shop use. If you are looking for more paper capacity, super-fast printing, regular photo paper printing, well then invest in a more feature-packed costlier printer. For a home, student, shop purpose L130 is stupendous! I am yet to try on a photo paper, but that is “extra” start if I get a decent print. If not, I’m happy the way it is.\\n\\nSingle-function is what you need today–Everyone has a decent smartphone that can scan and PDF documents using the camera. Free apps like Adobe Scan, Google Scan, CamScan, etc. can scan documents, align them, auto-correct colors, and will save you an extra 3-4K by buying a single-function (print only) printer. I see many reviews saying L130 is bad because it doesn’t scan! As it says, its a single function printer; it cannot scan.\\n\\nIt’s an ink tank–If you do not want to fall prey for the ink cartridge scam, you need to go for an ink tan printer. Yes, ink tanks (like the L130) are a little expensive than inkjets cartridge printers, but in the long run, ink tank gets you the best return on investment (ROI). Inkjets are available for 2k and does max of 50-60 color prints. Making you buy another cartridge for 1.5k every 60 color prints. L130 can yield you 5000+ color (and 4000+ monochrome) prints in just one refill. The printer comes with 4 sets of colors, and technically you do not have to worry for a few months/years without an ink change.\\n\\nCompact for the desk–In its compact state (when trays are inside), the depth as less than 30 cms., making it ideal for any normal shelf/cabinet. Input trays also fits a 1 ft tall shelf. As needed, retract the trays to place the papers. See photos as it is easier to understand that way ;). By far, this is the most compact ink tank printer I’ve seen.\\n\\nLoves Apple as much as Windows–This printer works smoothly (including installation in under 3 minutes) in Windows 10 and macOS 10.14 (yes, Mojave too!). Many reviews and Q&As indicating L130 doesn’t support a Mac. Well, sorry wrong informers… it does support a Mac and all you need is to go to Epson’s website to get the right driver.\\n\\nMake it wireless if you have the right router–L130 is a non-Wi-Finew lineon-wireless USB printer. A few years back, when I upgraded my W-Fi router to a dual band AC model, I went for a router with a USB port and with an inbuilt print server, though I never used that functionality till date. That decision came to use now! Yes, if you have a router with print server (and USB port), you can connect L130 to the router and use it wireless! One additional step beyond Epson’s driver setup is that you will need to install the router’s print utility/driver. Simple application you have to download from the router’s website and you have a USB printer that you can print directly from a PC/Mac connected to the WLAN.\\n\\nTake it to the cloud–Okay, now that you have realized that this is a print-only, home use, Mac friendly, and wireless “capable” printer, do you want to take it to the cloud? Meaning do you want to print from anywhere in the world? Well, folks, it is possible with some extra steps. As mentioned in my above bullet, if you have a router that has a print server and a USB port, make it connect to your WLAN. Once connected, register the printer to your Google Chrome account. Once registered, share the printer with any other Gmail accounts so that they too can print. For example, in my case, I registered my L130 in my Google account account using Chrome, and shared it with my family members’ Gmail ID. Now all of them can print from their Android, iOS, Amazon Fire, PC, Mac, from anywhere on the planet---as long as their devices and the printer at home is connected to the Internet.\\n\\nWell, that me after the third day of use, but 2 months or research. Good luck Amazonians!',\n",

From my image you can see all colours have been well developed. Got it for arnd rs.10,500 in nov'20 and immediately price was reduced to arnd 9,200rs :(. Anyways very very happy with the end result. Kit also had a 10 film pack, a photo bunting and 10 photo cards. Thank you amazon and the seller!!\",\n",

We had a problem with the ribbon wrinkling (the first time we used it), so they were nice enough to send us a replacement ribbon. They said if the new ribbon didn't fix the problem, it was probably the machine and it would need to be replaced. They NEVER said we needed to do this within the first 30 days. Here I am 2 months later (the second time I am using the printer), and the new ribbon did not solve the problem. Now, Brady will not replace the machine, but I can send it in for repairs, which takes 7 days. They will not send me a new machine. THIS IS NOT HELPFUL. I have orders that need to go out and can't without these labels, This machine is almost $1000, so the 30 day defective replacement warranty SUCKS.

Earlier my printer was Canon MF3010 with which I wasn't satisfied at all as the print quality was very light and after a couple of print, the colour got even lighter. Also, the refilling cost was around ₹700-800, so after using that printer for many years I was looking for another great printer for my home office. This time I needed a printer which has network printing capability, duplex printing, Google Cloud Printing and low maintenance/colour cost. Initially, I thought I would get an HP printer but none of them had all the features I was looking for and I will never buy Canon again in my life.\\nSo, after researching a lot I came across this Brother DCP-B7535DW printer which had everything that I needed. So, I started checking out reviews and finally decided to buy it. I bought it from my local Brother Distributer at ₹16,400/- whereas on Amazon it is being priced at ₹19,792/-. In fact, I also checked the price of this printer during Prime Day sale and the price was the same. Hence, I bought it from my local Brother distributor from way cheaper price than Amazon or any other online store.\\nHere are some TL;DR for the printer:\\nPros:\\n1. The printer has a super high printing speed.\\n2. Print quality is truly amazing\\n3. Cost of toner is about ₹650/- (Local Brother Distributor Price) which is cheaper than refilling while using the genuine product\\n4. Cost of the drum is around ₹1450/- (local distributor price) which you only need to change after 15,000 page print\\n5. The LCD is backlit, so you can see it in a dark environment too.\\n6. ADF is quite accurate and fast as well.\\n7. Print, scan, copy all are super fast. I scanned a page at 1200 dpi which took 15 sec to complete. Amazing.\\n8. Supports Google Cloud Print, which I'm enjoying a lot\\n9. Network Printing works flawlessly.\\n10. Printer shows ink low reminder when needed\\n11. All the software & firmware are always up to date. Brother do provide software support and update their drivers, firmware and software, which you can easily update using the Brother software. Even HP, Canon doesn't do that.\\n12. Also, did I say that the print quality is mind-blowing, it is even better than inkjet and local xerox machines.\\n13. Superfast duplex printing.\\n14. Build quality is very good.\\nCons:\\nFound nothing so far. If I do find any, will definitely update my review here.\\n\\nI can definitely say that this is the best printer I have used in my life. The upfront payment maybe a little high, but the features you are getting and the amazing printing quality along with low toner cost, trust me, in the long run, you will benefit from it.

Cost of the drum is around ₹1450/- (local distributor price) which you only need to change after 15,000 page print\\n5. The LCD is backlit, so you can see it in a dark environment too.\\n6. ADF is quite accurate and fast as well.\\n7. Print, scan, copy all are super fast. I scanned a page at 1200 dpi which took 15 sec to complete. Amazing.\\n8. Supports Google Cloud Print, which I'm enjoying a lot\\n9. Network Printing works flawlessly.\\n10. Printer shows ink low reminder when needed\\n11. All the software & firmware are always up to date. Brother do provide software support and update their drivers, firmware and software, which you can easily update using the Brother software. Even HP, Canon doesn't do that.\\n12. Also, did I say that the print quality is mind-blowing, it is even better than inkjet and local xerox machines.\\n13. Superfast duplex printing.\\n14. Build quality is very good.\\nCons:\\nFound nothing so far. If I do find any, will definitely update my review here.\\n\\nI can definitely say that this is the best printer I have used in my life. The upfront payment maybe a little high, but the features you are getting and the amazing printing quality along with low toner cost, trust me, in the long run, you will benefit from it. Also as this is a lazer printer even if you don't print daily, your ink won't stop working.\",\n",
       " 'HP 319 ink tank printer review -\\n\\n1. Purchased for 9700 Rs during Prime day sales\\n2. Delivery was done next day of order.\\n3. Installation process is quick and easy. Many YouTube videos available. Can ho through.\\n4. Print Quality is Excellent and great.\\n5. Scanner is very fast. Scans and prints within 20 sec for B&W and 40 sec for Colour\\n6. Printing speed is ok. 7-8 Prints for B&w per min and 3-4 Prints for Colour.\\n7. You will receive 2 Black ink bottles of 170 ml each which will print minimum 8000 pages of b&w practically which is very decent. Tricolor bottles of 80 ml each will print upto 3000 - 3500 colour pages of decent quality.\\n\\nWhy i opted HP 319 and not 310 or 315??\\nBecause it has 2 ink bottles of 170 ml plus blue design. 310 and 315 has only 1 bottle Rest everything is same in all 3.\\n\\nWhy i opted HP 319 and not 410,415 or 419???\\n319 does not have Wifi whereas 410,415 and 419 has wifi and you can print from mobile and will cost you minimum 3000 compared with 319. I dont have any use of Mobile printing and hence opted for 319. If you want to buy Wifi Printer, go for HP 419 as it is top model and 2 ink bottles of black with it as in case of 319.\\n\\nWhy not Epson, Canon or Brother ????\\nI liked the design and sturdiness of HP Printer and there were negative reviews and feedbacks about these 3.\\n\\nSo i hope my review will be one stop guide for all of you.\\n\\nThank You 😊',\n",

       " \"I purchased this printer a few months ago and have used it for several printouts till now. I had to b really thoughtful about its feedback , simply because buying printers online is quite a challenging decision especially the notorious reviews posted by many. At the end you trust your gut and make a decision. For most of the time people desire everything for the lowest price possible however please bear in mind quality demands research and money! So this is what i feel about the printer -\\n1. It looks great. Infact it looks pretty classy.\\n2. I love the print quality. It does so much justice for the image you want to print.\\n3. I paid 4890/- for the printer. The image print output is pretty satisfactory.\\n4. I printed a lot of sheets. Like, i totally went crazy with my print outs. I was working on a vision board project (more like a vision wall) and It required quite a bit of printouts. I hate going to the printer shops with the images I want to print as I have privacy issues. But so happy this printer did not even fuss once and facilitated smooth and steady printouts.\\n5. The installation was a cakewalk. It is compatible with my iPhone and Mac. Easy peasy. I love user friendly technology.\\n6. I have always inserted one sheet at a time. Why? because i find that arrangement quite hassle free and convenient.\\n7. A couple of times the paper got jammed. #commonprinterproblems. I did not feel that I should mind that. Given the convenience of home printing. Everything is better at home.\\n8. I took prints on regular sheets as well as glossy sheets. I would tell you this- , sheet type hardly made a difference. In future i'd use a regular sheet. Not a glossy one. I just tried glossy because may be I expected 'photo print quality'. While the print quality was great, the final print washed out the glossy effect. So it is redundant.\\n9. The printer uses the 803 ink cartridge and that is where the catch is.\\n10. 803 print cartridges clearly read that they are disposable and meant for single use only.\\n11. The original cartridge exhausted quite early. I am able to say this as I later ordered the refill ink and refilled my cartridge and I was able to get more prints this time. (It might be because with the original cartridge I printed glossy papers and they consume more ink. MAY BE. I'm just guessing.)\\n12. I watched a couple of Youtube videos and learnt how to refill the cartridge. I followed instructions and Viola! my printer started to shoot prints again.\\n13. Now , when you refill the original cartridge the printer's ink indicator does not read it. Which you'll learn to adapt because in moments your printer will be shooting pages after pages.\\n14. SO after several and many prints It was time to refill the cartridge. and Guess what...It did not work. I tried everything. The prints turned out horrible. The ink was spilling all over. Even inside the printer and that made me very sad. Nobody likes a tardy looking gadget!\\n15. My conclusion is that HP is right. 803 does not allow a refill. Even though the ink sellers claim and list that it does...It does not.\\n16. The first refill was may be a lucky shot. It worked. I was very happy. The second refill was a complete fiasco.\\n17. Eventually I discarded the cartridges.\\n18. I logged in to Amazon and wanted to place order for fresh cartridges and guess what. Out of all the HP models , 803 has the most expensive cartridge. That made me very thoughtful and cautious.\\n19. Unless HP does something about the price of the Ink cartridges, the ink will blot your enthusiasm.\\nMy verdict - It is a great printer. I love it. Love the print quality. But 803 is an EXORBITANTLY PRICED ink cartridge. May be i'll try the refills again when my next cartridge arrives and update my review just in case i am successful beyond the first refill attempt.

My printer didn’t read the color cartridge. It was an old generation piece and the black ink cartridge leaked during printing. It basically suggests that the cartridges are either refilled or not genuine. I later purchased them from HP website. Even though expensive I was content about the fact that they are genuine and have same business day delivery. I love the Amazon returns policy. They accepted the opened cartridge and refunded quite promptly.\\n\\nReview Update - Jan 24- it’s been six months the printer has been completely useless and I e been wondering what to do with it. Selling it on OLX seems like I’ll be cheating the buyer. I switched to a new ISP and the printer would not connect. I registered the call with HP CS . There was a lot of hassle. After spending around 72 hours back and forth they sent a technician. The printer just didn’t detect any connection with the phone, laptop and the WiFi. Technician refused to take any responsibility and said Ive been entering the password wrong. The technician and customer service people were so smart to place the blame because apparently the only device not connecting to the WiFi amongst the whole list of gadgets was the printer.\\nFinal Review is that as excited I was , it fizzled out so bad, that it is ridiculous to even think of giving the machine away for free as I’ll lose face if someone asks for a demo! I thought I’ll bear with the super highly priced ink but for a printer that doesn’t sync or connect, it’s a waste! It’s like a marriage which you realize is going bad within 6 months of being married!

But so happy this printer did not even fuss once and facilitated smooth and steady printouts.\\n5. The installation was a cakewalk. It is compatible with my iPhone and Mac. Easy peasy. I love user friendly technology.\\n6. I have always inserted one sheet at a time. Why? because i find that arrangement quite hassle free and convenient.\\n7. A couple of times the paper got jammed. #commonprinterproblems. I did not feel that I should mind that. Given the convenience of home printing. Everything is better at home.\\n8. I took prints on regular sheets as well as glossy sheets. I would tell you this- , sheet type hardly made a difference. In future i'd use a regular sheet. Not a glossy one. I just tried glossy because may be I expected 'photo print quality'. While the print quality was great, the final print washed out the glossy effect. So it is redundant.\\n9. The printer uses the 803 ink cartridge and that is where the catch is.\\n10. 803 print cartridges clearly read that they are disposable and meant for single use only.\\n11. The original cartridge exhausted quite early. I am able to say this as I later ordered the refill ink and refilled my cartridge and I was able to get more prints this time. (It might be because with the original cartridge I printed glossy papers and they consume more ink. MAY BE. I'm just guessing.)\\n12. I watched a couple of Youtube videos and learnt how to refill the cartridge. I followed instructions and Viola! my printer started to shoot prints again.\\n13. Now , when you refill the original cartridge the printer's ink indicator does not read it. Which you'll learn to adapt because in moments your printer will be shooting pages after pages.\\n14. SO after several and many prints It was time to refill the cartridge. and Guess what...It did not work. I tried everything. The prints turned out horrible. The ink was spilling all over. Even inside the printer and that made me very sad. Nobody likes a tardy looking gadget!\\n15. My conclusion is that HP is right. 803 does not allow a refill. Even though the ink sellers claim and list that it does...It does not.\\n16. The first refill was may be a lucky shot. It worked. I was very happy. The second refill was a complete fiasco.\\n17. Eventually I discarded the cartridges.\\n18. I logged in to Amazon and wanted to place order for fresh cartridges and guess what. Out of all the HP models , 803 has the most expensive cartridge. That made me very thoughtful and cautious.\\n19. Unless HP does something about the price of the Ink cartridges, the ink will blot your enthusiasm.\\nMy verdict - It is a great printer. I love it. Love the print quality. But 803 is an EXORBITANTLY PRICED ink cartridge. May be i'll try the refills again when my next cartridge arrives and update my review just in case i am successful beyond the first refill attempt. (UPDATE- the refill completely did not work with next new cartridge ran dry. Also I noticed that the new cartridge printed half the amount of papers from last time. Not sure of the decline)\\nI am not complaining because ultimately I have to take everything into consideration. But going to the printer shop is a BIG NO for me.\\n\\nReview Update 7th March- I realized the cartridge purchased from Amazon I.e 803 for this printer is not compatible. My printer didn’t read the color cartridge. It was an old generation piece and the black ink cartridge leaked during printing. It basically suggests that the cartridges are either refilled or not genuine. I later purchased them from HP website. Even though expensive I was content about the fact that they are genuine and have same business day delivery. I love the Amazon returns policy. They accepted the opened cartridge and refunded quite promptly.\\n\\nReview Update - Jan 24- it’s been six months the printer has been completely useless and I e been wondering what to do with it. Selling it on OLX seems like I’ll be cheating the buyer. I switched to a new ISP and the printer would not connect. I registered the call with HP CS . There was a lot of hassle. After spending around 72 hours back and forth they sent a technician. The printer just didn’t detect any connection with the phone, laptop and the WiFi. Technician refused to take any responsibility and said Ive been entering the password wrong. The technician and customer service people were so smart to place the blame because apparently the only device not connecting to the WiFi amongst the whole list of gadgets was the printer.\\nFinal Review is that as excited I was , it fizzled out so bad, that it is ridiculous to even think of giving the machine away for free as I’ll lose face if someone asks for a demo! I thought I’ll bear with the super highly priced ink but for a printer that doesn’t sync or connect, it’s a waste! It’s like a marriage which you realize is going bad within 6 months of being married! The benefit with the printer being - you have the freedom to discard it!\\nInterestingly I also feel that the shelf life of this printer is meant to last only for one bundle of sheets you buy. The printer exhausts post that! If you’re looking for a heavy use...you must buy the really expensive ones! Yes. That’s true.\\nHP customer service experience is 0/10.\",\n",
