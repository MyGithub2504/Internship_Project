       " \"After my 13inch MacBook I have tried several window laptops HP, Dell, Asus, Acer but this is first laptop that has amazed me with its extreme engineering design and a display to die for, stunning colours and best sound ever on a laptop, this beats MacBook retina display anyday and fast charge is amazing. I think it should be priced at 80k but surprisingly it's being sold at 69,999. The ports are more than adequate, the thunderbolt port and charging via USB is cherry on cake, fast charge, hdmi usb 3.2 port, only thing I felt was ram 8gb is just okay. You will forget hp, Lenovo and Dell and now I felt cheated on getting those mediocre specs and quality of laptops at 80k. You will not regret a bit once you hold this piece of beauty in your hands. WiFi 6 BT 5. Close your eyes and go for this you will love it and will become your routine companion. I have gray colour one and it's best. Fully recommend this laptop. Thanks Vaio for this amazing device.\",\n",

Keys are soft.\\n- light weight and very sturdy build quality.\\n- Packaging had 2 carton layers and then the laptop carton box itself. Don't fear about any transit damages.\\n- Camera is good enough to have a decent clarity during the call. Its very good in well lit condition.\\n- Heat is very well managed and the fan sound is not audible during normal use.\\nCons:\\n- Don't expect to play games in this laptop as this laptop is only for entertainment and study purpose. I dont play games so I dont care.\",\n",

       " \"This laptop is perfect for home and student use. Don't get blindsided by the negative reviews. The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.\\n\\nBenefits:\\n- Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter and battery gets warm which is quite normal.\\n- Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs.\\n- Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off.\\n- Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed.\\n- Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop.\\n- Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 40/100.\\n- Touchpad: smooth.\\n- Pre-activated Office 2019.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.\\n\\n- As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.\\n\\n- In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know how to use it properly.\\n\\n- At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.\\n\\n- Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.\\n\\n- If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop fan runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.\\n\\n- DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.\\n\\n- Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.\\n\\nThat's all folks!!!\",\n",

It has been 10 days, so cannot even return it. On the 6th day, the laptop went into a continuous restart loop which I fixed with hard shut down 3 times after watching some YouTube videos. And then it was working okay for 2 days. Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!\\n\\nUpdate 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!\\n\\nUpdate 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!\\n\\nJust lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.\\n\\n23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky.

       " \"This is the review of the 16-e0162AX model [ AMD Ryzen 5 with Radeon RX5500M GPU ]\\n\\nThe system is exactly the same as the GTX 1650 variant except for the GPU. In papers Radeon RX5500M is better than GTX 1650.\\n\\nFor the first impression, I like the overall design of the laptop.\\nThe screen looks fantastic. One of the major issue highlighted is the refresh rate but I do play games with PS4 connected to my TV / Projector and they are all 60 Hz only and I don't find it really bothering\\n\\nKeyboard is fun to type. Its backlit but only single color and brightness. The power button is part of the keyboard layout which requires us to be careful not to press it while trying to use the function keys\\n\\nThe trackpad is one of the best I would say.
