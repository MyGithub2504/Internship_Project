Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " 'Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.',\n",

I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty.

These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.\\nNOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.\\n●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY :\\n------------------\\nAll the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.\\n\\nVERDICT :\\n----------\\nI don\\'t think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.\\n\\nHope this review helps you make sound decision.',\n",
       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position.

       " 'Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.',\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage.

These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp.

To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI.

The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.',\n",

Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable.

Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class.

       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.\\nNOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.\\n●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY :\\n------------------\\nAll the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.\\n\\nVERDICT :\\n----------\\nI don\\'t think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies.

Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty.

But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.\\nNOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.\\n●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY :\\n------------------\\nAll the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.\\n\\nVERDICT :\\n----------\\nI don\\'t think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.\\n\\nHope this review helps you make sound decision.',\n",
       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position.

       " 'Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.',\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp.

To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI.

The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone.

Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable.

In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding.

       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty.

These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.\\nNOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.\\n●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY :\\n------------------\\nAll the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.\\n\\nVERDICT :\\n----------\\nI don\\'t think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.\\n\\nHope this review helps you make sound decision.',\n",
       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position.

       " 'Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.',\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp.

To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI.

The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone.

Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable.

In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding.

       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty.

These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.\\nNOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.\\n●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY :\\n------------------\\nAll the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.\\n\\nVERDICT :\\n----------\\nI don\\'t think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.\\n\\nHope this review helps you make sound decision.',\n",
       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position.

       " 'Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.',\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp.

To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI.

The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone.

Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable.

In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding.

       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty.

These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.\\nNOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.\\n●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY :\\n------------------\\nAll the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.\\n\\nVERDICT :\\n----------\\nI don\\'t think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.\\n\\nHope this review helps you make sound decision.',\n",
       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position.

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",

And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.\\n\\nThese boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.\\nIf you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.\\nthere are no concerns according to me till now .\\nI'll update when something goes wrong.\\n\\nUpdate !!!\\n\\nSo im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.\\n\\nAs i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.\\n\\nThank you\",\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " \" I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",
       " 'The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.\\n\\nThe headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.\\n\\nOverall, its worth for money purchase.',\n",

       " 'Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.',\n",

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office.

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone.

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.\\n\\nThese boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.\\nIf you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.\\nthere are no concerns according to me till now .\\nI'll update when something goes wrong.\\n\\nUpdate !!!\\n\\nSo im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues .

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees.\",\n",
       " \" I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.\\n\\nThese boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.\\nIf you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.\\nthere are no concerns according to me till now .\\nI'll update when something goes wrong.\\n\\nUpdate !!!\\n\\nSo im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues .

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone.

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",
       " \"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs.\",\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",
       " \"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs.\",\n",

This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass.\",\n",
       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",

Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of.

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " \" I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office.

I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone.

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.\\n\\nThese boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.\\nIf you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.\\nthere are no concerns according to me till now .\\nI'll update when something goes wrong.\\n\\nUpdate !!!\\n\\nSo im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues .

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " \" I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " \"Play Video\\n I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone.

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.\\n\\nHope this review helps you make sound decision.',\n",

And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.\\n\\nThese boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.\\nIf you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.\\nthere are no concerns according to me till now .\\nI'll update when something goes wrong.\\n\\nUpdate !!!\\n\\nSo im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues .

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",
       " \"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs.\",\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",
       " \"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs.\",\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

Other wise it's excellent.\\nSweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.\\nOver all its a good deal @ 699/-\\nGuys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass.\",\n",
       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " \" I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.\\n\\nThese boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.\\nIf you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.\\nthere are no concerns according to me till now .\\nI'll update when something goes wrong.\\n\\nUpdate !!!\\n\\nSo im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues .

I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",

And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.\\n\\nThese boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.\\nIf you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.\\nthere are no concerns according to me till now .\\nI'll update when something goes wrong.\\n\\nUpdate !!!\\n\\nSo im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.\\n\\nAs i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.\\n\\nThank you\",\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",

       " \"This review is after 4 hours of continuous usage on very first day. I exposed my ear drums to different genre of music, pop, rock, Bollywood, Punjabi beats, bass boosted, 8D bass boosted music and devotional in the end. The experience was mesmerising. Lemme brief my experience here:\\nPackage:\\nBox contains over-the-ear headphones, 3.5mm jack cable of almost 1.5 m length with microphone, 3.5mm to 6.3mm curl cable can be extended to very good length, a pouch, a warranty card of 24 months, and a charity/donation card for some NGO.\\n\\nBuild Quality:\\nHeadphones are of plastic, yet it looks like metal frames for over-ear frames. Quality looks superb, gives premium feel. Cushions are of big size, easily embraced my bigger-than-normal ear 👂. Also cushion didn't give me itchy feel after usage. It's really soft. Metal hinges for size adjustments, gives sturdy feel. Red thread lining over the band with embossed branding is nice. What amazed me most is cables quality, truly industry class. I simply loved the headphones due to cables quality.\\n\\nSound:\\nTried the headphones with almost all genres of music. Even the 8D bass boosted music. And my true feeling was like I am listening music in a home theatre system. I felt like music if coming from a distance, may be from the ceiling or corner of room. It was great feeling. So no pain to ears. Very well surround music feel.\\nObviously I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.com, with overwhelming reviews from US or other countries buyers. Overall I am feeling like it's Wise buying from my side. Will definitely add more after quite few days.\\nMy satisfaction level : 5/5.\",\n",

       " \"Amazing! After a long time I got something perfect. I am a sound engineer , so it's very hard for me to select a earphone . But trust me it sounds like my sennheiser studio headphones. Perfect lows ,perfect mid, perfect highs . And the best part is I got this earphone at just 380 rupees.\",\n",
       " \" I am using these pTron tengent bluetooth neckband from 3 days its superb and amazing sound quality . The thing i like the most is the price, yes! It is the best deal under this price segment must buy if anyone want to buy a new bluetooth neckband .. let's come to its features it comes with bluetooth 5.0 and yes its connection speed to good enough . Accordingg to my experience the battery life is about 6 hours and charging time is very less it charge within 1.5 hours which is enough . Based on my experience the bass is very good ☺️☺️ ofcourse it comes with 10mm drivers so the bass is just decent .. And if i talk about build quality its also decent very good quality material is used by pTron i am fully satisfied with these and last but not least the weight of these neckbandd is very light so just these are very comfortable enaough and looks prety cool 😍.. this is my honest review about this product i think anyone of you in search of buying the new bluetooth neckband then go for it these are amazing under this price segment ..\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",
       " 'The headphone is great to hear music, to talk on calls. It has built in noise cancellation feature. That is awesome to use.\\n\\nThe headphones are lightweight to handle. And the mic feature is great to use.\\n\\nOverall, its worth for money purchase.',\n",

The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.',\n",

       " \"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).\\n\\nPacking :\\nThe packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.\\n\\nBox contents :\\nBoult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).\\n\\nFirst impression :\\n\\nThe earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.\\n\\nButtons :\\n\\nThe brick on the right side has the buttons.\\nWe get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.\\nYou can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.\\n\\nConnectivity :\\n\\nPairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.\\n\\nBattery:\\n\\nThe company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.\\n\\nAdditional features :\\n\\nThese earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)\\nBut remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.\\n\\nSound quality :\\n\\nSound quality in these earphones are amazing.\\nThe mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.\\nThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .\\nThese earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.\\n\\nThese boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.\\nIf you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.\\nthere are no concerns according to me till now .\\nI'll update when something goes wrong.\\n\\nUpdate !!!\\n\\nSo im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.\\n\\nAs i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.\\n\\nThank you\",\n",

       " 'I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\nSOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!\\n\\nThe sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.\\n\\nMIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.\\n\\nLATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).\\n\\nCOMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.\\n\\nI think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.\\n\\nUPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:\\n\\nVery happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙',\n",
       " \"I am not aware of what is noise cancelation but one of my friend showed in her BOSE headset, when u press one button all external noise gets disappear and one vaccume gets created between your ear and headset. In pTron once you plug in you ear some extent of external noise gets reduce and once you play the sound or using it for Teams meeting you can't hear what your wife says...so seems good for all those WFH men who wants to have break from their wife's kirkir ;P Kidding. Bass appears to be ok. For all these features price should be less by 50 ton75 Rs.\",\n",
