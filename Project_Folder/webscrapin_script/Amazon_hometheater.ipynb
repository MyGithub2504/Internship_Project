Bluetooth volume is a little higher than Aux volume. It is almost parallel to Panasonic ht 21. Bass enclosure is sturdy and satellite speakers are light. Sound quality is good and clear. Bass is nice and my room 12x20ft room is booming like speaker enclosure. For some english songs I have to reduce bass in my player app for appropriate good bass. So far everything goes well as anticipated. I can’t understand why such a nice product Akai has very little response in market. Perhaps Indians are more incline to Philips, Sony and Panasonic. In audio systems Akai is identical to Sony and I am using Akai music systems since 1981 when my father bought it for me',\n",

A cable for connecting dth or tv or the like....is provided....which has av sockets at one end and the 3.5 mm stereo jack at the other end for connection to other devices like the mentioned.\\n7. A wire runs out from the side which acts as fm antenna and could be extended in case you need to place atenna outside.\\n8. Display is bright and readable which provides necessary info like usb or bt or fm and volume plus it indicates power or standby.\\nCons.\\n1. The power switch is on the side panel of sub. In addition you can turn it off in remote controller which is easy, but doing so doesn't cut the power to the main board since it gets heated and also it powers the usb drive that you have plugged in, which turns it hot.\\n2. The initial volume level, i.e. , level 1 itself is very loud which turns to be a great drawback when you dont want to disturb others.\\n3. The device doesn't have a memory to store settings, so once you turn off the power plug, and you turn it on next time it starts with a very high volume say level 12 or so. However it remains in the same mode...i.e. ...bt or usb or so.... that you have last used it before power off.\\n\\nAltogether it is a recommended product.

Bluetooth volume is a little higher than Aux volume. It is almost parallel to Panasonic ht 21. Bass enclosure is sturdy and satellite speakers are light. Sound quality is good and clear. Bass is nice and my room 12x20ft room is booming like speaker enclosure. For some english songs I have to reduce bass in my player app for appropriate good bass. So far everything goes well as anticipated. I can’t understand why such a nice product Akai has very little response in market. Perhaps Indians are more incline to Philips, Sony and Panasonic. In audio systems Akai is identical to Sony and I am using Akai music systems since 1981 when my father bought it for me',\n",

I suggest not to go for this product as it is not having any latest features, even sony installation person is saying that this is waste of money and you should go for higher model which Rs.22,000. My personal advise is not to go for this product and before buying any product, please call direct company customer service to understand the features.',\n",

       " \"Not worth hype given on various you tube channels and online reviews. Very average product, very low output, very low sound, poor tweeters, low bass, simple very flat sound which will not give feeling of satisfaction combined with a very low volume. I had submitted a detailed review which Amazon ecommerce team have removed and they are not placing it back even after multiple follow ups. Hope this one will also be removed. No immersive sound. Felt cheated when I first listened to it. Volume was so low that what good a tweeter or woofer would do when enough sound is not there. Volume button dies where one wants it to start. Burn out period is a myth. Think for a while. Does any other brand talks about any such thing. Answer is NO. It's just a flat desi DHOLL with flat output which 90% people will not like. Felt like listening to songs while seated in a state transport bus. Obage don't either have any outlet where you can listen these first. Don't buy anything on anybody's recommendation before actually testing the system for real and spending your hard earned money. And this system is heavy just bcoz of heaviness of wooden material.... It's not like other quality aspects are heavy or worth discussion. It is heavy to be just heavy by weight only... nothing which could guarantee an immersive sound. Very average product. Not for youngsters or low bass lovers even... forget those who love actual bass. Just suitable for bhajans and old low melodies when you sit in front of the speakers....Feels sturdy on built only, rest is a myth as you buy a music system for listening and not for your antique showcase... Test any system somewhere before purchasing it as you may suffer and regret with ht 144 kind of system. Obage people correctly mention it as not for loud listeners...Volume output will never satisfy a heartful listener one who wants to enjoy the song. My 32 inch old toshiba tv speakees have a loud output than this. You tube hype seems not be genuine. Strongly hope this review will get removed soon as was done with my previous detailed review.\",\n",

Bluetooth volume is a little higher than Aux volume. It is almost parallel to Panasonic ht 21. Bass enclosure is sturdy and satellite speakers are light. Sound quality is good and clear. Bass is nice and my room 12x20ft room is booming like speaker enclosure. For some english songs I have to reduce bass in my player app for appropriate good bass. So far everything goes well as anticipated. I can’t understand why such a nice product Akai has very little response in market. Perhaps Indians are more incline to Philips, Sony and Panasonic. In audio systems Akai is identical to Sony and I am using Akai music systems since 1981 when my father bought it for me',\n",

       " 'I have been using 301 for some time and loving it. I wanted to buy another sound system for my other room, so I called up Obage customer care. Those guys really guide well. I was surprised to know that 101, despite being costlier than 301, has lesser sound output than 301. But the cost difference is due to sound quality, not sound quantity.\\nSo i bought 101 as I wanted soothing sound for my room.\\n\\nI used 101 for few days and reached the following conclusion :\\n\\n301 is for those people who like loud music, boomy bass, crisp highs. The loudness of 301 is certainly more than 101. 301 is a very bright sound system in terms of sound.\\n\\n101 is very clear and soothing. It has deeper bass than 301. I was amazed to see that 101 reaches down to 40Hz of bass which is phenomenal for this cost. Highs are very decent in 101. For long hours of listening, 101 is perfect. It takes a certain amount of time for ears to get adjusted to the sound of 101 as it is very melodious, and once the ears get accustomed to 101, it is addictive! The sound stage of 101 is very wide and detailed. I can listen to all instruments clearly on 101. But 101 is not at all loud.\\n\\nNow, when I am in a mood of listening to classical, ghazals, soft music, English Rock, hip hop, I go to 101. Even songs of Arijit or latest bollywood movies, if I want to listen on less sound, I go to 101. It is best for peaceful listening.\\n\\nI go to 301 when i want to listen to loud music, bollywood item numbers, or even disturb the neighbors sometimes hahaha. 301 really spices up the surrounding.\\n\\nMy verdict : 301 is spicy, 101 is sweet. I love them both!',\n",

       " 'IMPORTANT NOTE:\\n\\nFirst off all, getting a good surround system is dependent not only on the speakers but many other factors. Your experience is going to be poor no matter which sound system you buy unless you consider for these factors.\\n\\nTo get a good surround sound system you should consider:\\n\\n1. Whether the content you\\'re playing has a 5.1ch sound output in the first place\\n\\n2. Whether the app and/or device you\\'re playing it in supports a 5.1ch output (for e.g. YouTube app does not have a 5.1ch output)\\n\\n3. Whether your connectivity supports a 5.1ch output; not all devices/connections support 5.1ch (for e.g. if you connect the speakers through a normal 3.5mm jack, you\\'ll only get a stereo output)\\n\\nSo when comments here say the \"5.1 doesn\\'t work\" take that not with a pinch of salt but with \\'bunch\\' of salt.\\n\\nI have been using the sound system for a little over 2 months and I can say with 100% confidence that it works with absolute charm!!\\n\\nTherefore before you go ahead and make this purchase, please do find out if the device that you intend to hook this up with, has the capability to output 5.1ch through HDMI Arc connection. Not all TVs/devices support this, therefore you\\'ll end up having all the devices but not getting the surround system feel.\\n\\nNow coming to the sound system in itself.\\n\\nIt is a bit of a bummer that the Front Right, Centre and Front Left are in a single sound bar. Ideally you would want them to be slightly spaced. But there is the advantage of the soundbar fitting snugly right below the TV and looking pretty cool. It does give an artificial \"spacing\", so no complains here.\\n\\nThe Surround Left and Right satellites come with a 10m long wire. They need to be placed at 90-110° from where you sit and since most ideal TV viewing distances are less than 4m, there shouldnt be a problem with lack of length.\\n\\nPlease Google for speaker placement for 5.1ch and you\\'ll come across Dolby recommended positions. Follow that and you\\'re good to go!\\n\\nThe sound itself is amazing! Gives a very good cinematic experience (assuming you have considered all the aforementioned 3 factors). With HDMI Arc connectivity, you should be able to control the speaker volume with your TV remote itself, but this is something that you need to check with your TV.',\n",

Whether the app and/or device you\\'re playing it in supports a 5.1ch output (for e.g. YouTube app does not have a 5.1ch output)\\n\\n3. Whether your connectivity supports a 5.1ch output; not all devices/connections support 5.1ch (for e.g. if you connect the speakers through a normal 3.5mm jack, you\\'ll only get a stereo output)\\n\\nSo when comments here say the \"5.1 doesn\\'t work\" take that not with a pinch of salt but with \\'bunch\\' of salt.\\n\\nI have been using the sound system for a little over 2 months and I can say with 100% confidence that it works with absolute charm!!\\n\\nTherefore before you go ahead and make this purchase, please do find out if the device that you intend to hook this up with, has the capability to output 5.1ch through HDMI Arc connection. Not all TVs/devices support this, therefore you\\'ll end up having all the devices but not getting the surround system feel.\\n\\nNow coming to the sound system in itself.\\n\\nIt is a bit of a bummer that the Front Right, Centre and Front Left are in a single sound bar. Ideally you would want them to be slightly spaced. But there is the advantage of the soundbar fitting snugly right below the TV and looking pretty cool. It does give an artificial \"spacing\", so no complains here.\\n\\nThe Surround Left and Right satellites come with a 10m long wire. They need to be placed at 90-110° from where you sit and since most ideal TV viewing distances are less than 4m, there shouldnt be a problem with lack of length.\\n\\nPlease Google for speaker placement for 5.1ch and you\\'ll come across Dolby recommended positions. Follow that and you\\'re good to go!\\n\\nThe sound itself is amazing! Gives a very good cinematic experience (assuming you have considered all the aforementioned 3 factors). With HDMI Arc connectivity, you should be able to control the speaker volume with your TV remote itself, but this is something that you need to check with your TV.',\n",

       " ' This is the first time I’ve ordered from Elevn and I must say the quality of the speakers is great for music as well as movies. The speakers come with attached wires, one of which is the jack of 3.5 mm and the other is the power cable which you could either connect to your laptop or PC and can even be connected to a phone with the help of a power bank. The speakers also have a volume controller which makes it so much easier to increase or decrease volume and the best part is you can travel with these mini speakers as it is very convenient to carry them around. Overall I love the sound quality for the price that I paid and would definitely recommend people to go ahead and buy this product!',\n",
